(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) The wind of the changing

2
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.810
seasons blows In the shining, most beautiful

3
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.610
paradise Lightly crossing over to

4
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:36.650
a new era A finger pointing to the

5
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.030
future on its own I wanna dive into

6
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.410
paradise It's all so trendy So I

7
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.150
'll wear it and be strong I'll

8
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.850
definitely steal your heart Ready, set, go!

9
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.710
Everybody can do!

10
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.730
I started running My dream doesn't always

11
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.250
stop I won't regret it tomorrow Everybody

12
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.270
can do!

13
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.930
Even if it's a little dark I

14
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.330
don't want to see it I'm

15
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.870
excited and curious I'll be strong and

16
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:29.690
strong I'm not

17
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.570
afraid of banning!

18
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.570
I don't have to say it again,

19
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.270
but this month is the Month of Contact

20
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.370
with the Region.

21
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.010
We aim to be a police force that

22
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.110
is loved by the local residents.

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.670
Be kind to the local residents.

24
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.710
Yes, sir!

25
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.130
What should I say to the police?

26
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.750
The police station is right over there.

27
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.130
I'll show you the way.

28
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.450
Let's carry our luggage.

29
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.550
Thank you.

30
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.430
I'll take you to the police station.

31
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.850
That's the real police.

32
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.570
This is what a police officer looks like.

33
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.490
By the way, where's Ryo?

34
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.590
He went out on patrol, but he was

35
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.270
with Ms. Honda at 10 p.

36
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.390
m.

37
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.190
last night.

38
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.050
This is bad!

39
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.290
The chief's order has already begun.

40
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.710
It's going to be tough.

41
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.890
We've gone too far.

42
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.730
He said he wanted to see Sado.

43
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.210
He said he wanted to see Sado.

44
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.890
I thought he'd be back by dawn.

45
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.930
What should we do?

46
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.410
They say they're on the move, but

47
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.950
they're such a nuisance.

48
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.670
Let's get rid of them.

49
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.050
Leave it to me.

50
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.410
What are you doing at the police station?

51
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.670
This is our island.

52
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.090
This is the island of the Vio

53
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.970
lence Special.

54
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.350
I won't let you do as you

55
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.450
please.

56
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.630
Are you going to fight with us?

57
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.150
That's great.

58
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.060
They're a pain in the ass.

59
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.820
It's 10 years too early to fight

60
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.920
us.

61
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.040
You're strong.

62
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.120
Who are you?

63
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.300
I'm Honda Hayato of the Mobile

64
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.540
Task Force.

65
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.340
I'm a high-end Honda.

66
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.500
Who are you?

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.900
I'm Ryotsu of the

68
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.980
Kamigari Kouenmae

69
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.500
Hashijo.

70
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.960
If you have a problem, I'll fight

71
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.080
you anytime.

72
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.720
I remember you, Honda Ryotsu.

73
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.660
I'm sure the chief will watch a

74
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.020
lot this morning.

75
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.080
After all, we've defeated two of the

76
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.180
Violence Special.

77
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.540
The best thing to do is to beat

78
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.640
them up.

79
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.640
I'm hurt.

80
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.800
Don't worry.

81
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.900
It won't take long.

82
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.520
Really?

83
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.640
I hope so.

84
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.700
Good morning.

85
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.980
I'm sorry I'm late.

86
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.960
Ryotsu!

87
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.460
Honda!

88
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.380
What the hell did you do?

89
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.560
I just got a phone call from the

90
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.660
office.

91
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.900
What?

92
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.300
You're banning me from going home?

93
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.600
What's going on?

94
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.500
Nothing's going on.

95
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.700
Ryotsu!

96
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.020
Honda!

97
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.220
Thanks to you, I've been getting a

98
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.880
lot of calls.

99
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.640
I'm terribly sorry.

100
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm Fuyuki Soudok

101
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.200
i, the chief.

102
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.360
You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.

103
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.020
Ouch!

104
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.720
Wait a minute.

105
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.040
We just beat up the Viole

106
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.280
nce Special.

107
00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.120
Why do we have to be punished?

108
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.860
You guys are involving the general public.

109
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.820
What?

110
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.360
The general public is angry.

111
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.580
Ryotsu!

112
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.960
This month is the month to strengthen our

113
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.060
relationship with the region.

114
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.700
And yet you...

115
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.940
You've ruined the trust of the general

116
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.040
public.

117
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.820
I repeat my punishment.

118
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.180
Ryotsu!

119
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.480
Honda!

120
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.500
You're grounded for a week from today.

121
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.300
You must reflect on your actions.

122
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.820
Yes, sir.

123
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.280
Ouch!

124
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.300
What?

125
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.900
What?

126
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.840
You're grounded for a week.

127
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.240
That's the same as getting a vacation.

128
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.940
Now, I'm going to make a pile

129
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.660
of plums.

130
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.660
You're so annoying.

131
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.700
You didn't get a single cent.

132
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.640
But you got a week off.

133
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.220
You should be happier.

134
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.200
But I can't ride my bike for

135
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.300
a long time.

136
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.180
What should I do?

137
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.620
Just do what you like.

138
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.480
Don't you have any hobbies?

139
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.100
I don't have any hobbies other than

140
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.200
riding a bike.

141
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.220
Now that you mention it, I don't

142
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.420
think Honda is doing anything.

143
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.500
If you don't have anything to do,

144
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.420
just sleep in your room.

145
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.380
A week is too short.

146
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.940
A week is too short.

147
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.020
What?

148
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.500
What was that?

149
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.600
Bike...

150
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.940
Honda!

151
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.140
Where did you come from?

152
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.260
My bike...

153
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.420
Where is my bike?

154
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.220
I haven't finished the plums yet.

155
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.680
Where did you get my bike?

156
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.160
Stop it!

157
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.700
I bought it on the Internet.

158
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.240
It's a Yamaha Pilargo

159
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.140
XV400.

160
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.480
It's a real-type model.

161
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.760
It's less than $500.

162
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.680
It's an even smaller bike.

163
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.620
I can't get it anymore because it

164
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.720
's a limited edition.

165
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.820
Where is my bike?

166
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.820
Wait!

167
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.300
As long as I have this, I can

168
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.880
live a fun life.

169
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.420
I have to do something.

170
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.740
Excuse me.

171
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.380
Ryo, where are you?

172
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.940
I've been waiting for you.

173
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.900
I brought a lot of things.

174
00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.720
What are you going to use them for?

175
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.920
I'll make Honda have a hobby.

176
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.700
A hobby other than riding a bike?

177
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.960
Yes.

178
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.260
Look at that.

179
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.940
Are you all right?

180
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.280
Honda!

181
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.580
Are you all right?

182
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.300
Why am I here?

183
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.100
It's because you haven't ridden

184
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.360
a bike for a day.

185
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.440
This is a serious injury.

186
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.340
Honda is in the same situation as a

187
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:31.679
young salaryman.

188
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.059
A young man whose job was a hobby

189
00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.400
was robbed of his hobby.

190
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.419
As soon as he was robbed of his

191
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.960
hobby, he got a blow.

192
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.840
Especially a young man like you.

193
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.180
That's the most dangerous thing.

194
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.020
What's wrong with me?

195
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:50.920
Chief!

196
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.400
Why are you here?

197
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.220
I'm in charge of your supervision.

198
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.060
I'm here to make sure you don

199
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.760
't cause any trouble.

200
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.320
There's already no problem.

201
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.880
I'm not angry.

202
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.120
Idiot!

203
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.940
What are you thinking about?

204
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.700
It's time to reflect on yourself.

205
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.640
You can't do that as a hobby.

206
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.340
Chief!

207
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.160
Look at this.

208
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.520
Where's my bike?

209
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.700
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

210
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.380
I'm going to get sick.

211
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:25.680
I'm going to get sick.

212
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.920
I may never be able to return to

213
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.020
my job.

214
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.700
No way!

215
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.040
Honda is a talented salaryman.

216
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.520
Of course, the chief will be held responsible.

217
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.060
He was put in jail for not being

218
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.160
able to manage.

219
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.300
He was sentenced to death.

220
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.360
He was sent to a desolate village.

221
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.580
Among the people who are more sensitive to

222
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:48.680
rumors than the city.

223
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.840
He had a lot of trouble with his

224
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.260
subordinates.

225
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.360
He had a lot of trouble with his

226
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.600
subordinates.

227
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.000
His wife and daughter couldn't stand it

228
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.100
anymore.

229
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.000
They left the house.

230
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.460
They didn't know what to do.

231
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.080
They didn't know how to go back

232
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.040
to Tokyo.

233
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.000
They were left alone.

234
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.400
They had a hard time.

235
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.540
Okay.

236
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.940
I'll give you special permission.

237
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560
Thank you very much.

238
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.900
That's why I'm the chief of

239
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.120
the subordinates.

240
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.540
I'm the chief of the subordin

241
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:21.640
ates.

242
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.720
I'm good at getting people on my

243
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:23.820
bike.

244
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.820
You're good at it.

245
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.400
It's good to be away from work.

246
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.660
Shut up!

247
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.220
I'm good at getting people on my

248
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:38.320
bike.

249
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.340
In that case, you should be away

250
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:39.880
from your bike.

251
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.820
How about collecting coins?

252
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.120
Collecting coins...

253
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.880
You can start today.

254
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.160
First of all, it's the effect of

255
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.260
Japan.

256
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.600
1 yen coin, 5 yen, 10 yen, 100

257
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.540
yen, 500 yen.

258
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.680
The 10 yen coin of Showa 26

259
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.500
has a value of more than 100 yen.

260
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.140
I see.

261
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.240
It's a coin collection.

262
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.120
Oh, this looks like a bike wheel.

263
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.900
It's perfect for you.

264
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.200
I'd rather have a real bike wheel.

265
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.040
Chief, that's no good.

266
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.920
You're saying things that make me think

267
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.140
of a bike.

268
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.020
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:16.940
That's right.

270
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.920
That's right.

271
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.940
How about knitting?

272
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.980
I'm sure it's perfect for you.

273
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.800
Knitting?

274
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.140
That's right.

275
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.780
You can make a muffler easily.

276
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.680
Muffler?

277
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.300
Muffler?

278
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.000
Dancing is popular these days, isn't it?

279
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.580
Dance.

280
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.680
Fork dance.

281
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.940
Fork...

282
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.320
Fork...

283
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.960
That's right.

284
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.200
That's right.

285
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.360
That's right.

286
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.080
It's a book.

287
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.960
The story of the Trap Family of

288
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.820
Trap Danshaku is moving.

289
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.960
Danshaku, Danshaku, Dansh

290
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.220
aku, Danshaku...

291
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.080
No, I'd rather have a bike.

292
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.940
Chief, shut up and dance.

293
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.920
I'm sorry.

294
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.560
Bike!

295
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:05.980
Bike!

296
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.430
Let's go, Ryo.

297
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.330
Let's go, Honda.

298
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.690
Good morning, senpai.

299
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.030
Are you awake, Ryo?

300
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.410
Oh, you're here.

301
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.770
Come in.

302
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.850
Excuse me.

303
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.690
It'll be over soon, so wait.

304
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.730
Were you playing games all night?

305
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.230
I wanted to sleep, but I couldn't.

306
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:02.810
Because of him.

307
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:22.670
Honda, what are you doing?

308
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.690
What?

309
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.030
If I crush this one by one in

310
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.070
a second, I can ride a bike with

311
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.970
430,922 more crushes.

312
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.350
Are you going to keep doing that while

313
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.450
you're grounded?

314
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.250
It's going to be a good show.

315
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.790
All right, it's over.

316
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.270
Now, Honda, let's get started.

317
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.430
What do you mean, let's get started?

318
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.390
You can tell by looking at Nak

319
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.430
agawa and Reiko's clothes.

320
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.950
It's tennis, tennis.

321
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.650
Speaking of tennis, it's a hobby.

322
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.370
It's popular regardless of age.

323
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.570
In addition, Japanese women's tennis is world

324
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.030
-class.

325
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.410
If you don't play tennis now, you

326
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.790
can't be called Japanese.

327
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.210
Yesterday, I failed in the cultural system.

328
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.810
Today, I decided to go with the sports

329
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.110
system.

330
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.650
It's before work, so I can't

331
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:09.230
play with you for long.

332
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.530
Let's move your body a little.

333
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.470
You'll be able to refresh your mind

334
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.870
and body.

335
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.390
No, I'm doing this.

336
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.610
If you do that, you'll be in

337
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.710
a bad mood.

338
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.810
Now, wait.

339
00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:22.550
I'm not done yet.

340
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.170
If I play tennis, my body will break.

341
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.690
What are you talking about?

342
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.070
Is Ryosu there?

343
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.930
Ryosu, Honda, you're fired.

344
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.430
I won't forgive you anymore.

345
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:36.550
What?

346
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.590
fired?

347
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.150
What's wrong, chief?

348
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.110
I don't care what happened.

349
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.210
I don't care what happened.

350
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:43.950
Even though they're on a bre

351
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.090
ak, Last night, there was a big r

352
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.190
uckus in Kannana.

353
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.150
What?

354
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.670
Last night at 2 o'clock, Honda, K

355
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.730
ameari, Kouenmai, and

356
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.350
Ryosu appeared on Kannana

357
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.770
Street.

358
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.770
It's called Torishimari,

359
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.430
and it's a lot of cars.

360
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.330
There's a lot of people in the

361
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:06.430
park.

362
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.270
It's a big deal.

363
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.830
That's not us.

364
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.730
Shut up!

365
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.630
So you guys are fake?

366
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.950
From the testimony of the witness, I know

367
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:18.930
you two are not mistaken.

368
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.810
No way.

369
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.330
The formal treatment will come out

370
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:23.890
in a few days.

371
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.130
Probably Honda has a license and a license

372
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:27.230
plate.

373
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.350
License and license plate?

374
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.070
Ryosu also has a license and

375
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.430
a license plate.

376
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.190
There's no doubt about that.

377
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.610
Until the conclusion comes out, be quiet in

378
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:39.710
the dormitory.

379
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.990
Listen, don't ever go outside.

380
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.390
Ryo-chan, anyway, I can't

381
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.970
believe that Honda ignores the ban and

382
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.090
roams around outside.

383
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.710
That's true.

384
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.270
Anyway, in the case of Honda, It's

385
00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.550
natural to think that someone is talking about

386
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.930
it and roaming around.

387
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.450
Do you believe Honda and don't trust

388
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.950
me at all?

389
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.770
That's not it.

390
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.410
The way Honda looks...

391
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:10.630
Huh?

392
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.970
He was here a while ago.

393
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.030
Honda!

394
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.910
That guy!

395
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:19.810
No way!

396
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.910
Honda!

397
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.570
Nakagawa!

398
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:27.270
Yes!

399
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.010
Ringo!

400
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.550
Yes!

401
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.050
Honda!

402
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.750
Honda!

403
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.390
Honda!

404
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.510
Honda!

405
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.050
Idiot!

406
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:46.690
Stop it!

407
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:47.510
You're going to die!

408
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.710
What are you doing?

409
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.750
Honda, please calm down.

410
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.190
I'm sure the truth will be revealed

411
00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.650
and the ban will be lifted.

412
00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:58.870
That's right.

413
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.730
Be sure to be careful, Honda!

414
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.030
If you die, your father, mother, Your sister,

415
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.010
Eve, and your brother's family, And your

416
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.450
grandfather, Koki, will be

417
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:09.750
sad.

418
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.109
What are you talking about?

419
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.710
I was just looking at the motorcycle.

420
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.160
Don't be ridiculous!

421
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.760
Don't be ridiculous!

422
00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:24.839
Senpai!

423
00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:25.619
Ryo-chan!

424
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.570
Don't move, Ryo-chan.

425
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.030
I'm the one who got scratched.

426
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.130
If you're just a normal person, you

427
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:41.630
'll get hurt.

428
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.430
If this continues, he'll really get angry.

429
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:45.830
That's true.

430
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.690
There's a high possibility.

431
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.230
There's no time to lose.

432
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.770
Let's hurry and catch the real culprit.

433
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.130
I'll help too.

434
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.470
Ryo-chan, who can live without

435
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.430
the police, I feel sorry for Honda.

436
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.930
Senpai, Honda...

437
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.330
Don't drag me into this!

438
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.750
It looks like the police are making a

439
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.850
scene.

440
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.050
If we cause a problem today, we'll

441
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:26.430
be beheaded.

442
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.730
Oh, it's Honda.

443
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.750
Let's go, Ryo-chan's

444
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.910
husband!

445
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.570
Yeah!

446
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.070
Hey!

447
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.790
Hey, hey!

448
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.370
Make way!

449
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.770
It's Kouki's Honda car!

450
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.510
There's also a Ryo-chan

451
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.650
who's not afraid of anything.

452
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.640
I hate red.

453
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.580
I'll pay you 50,000 yen if

454
00:18:59.580 --> 00:18:59.680
you don't like it.

455
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:00.820
Senpai!

456
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.360
Shut up!

457
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.480
Don't make a scene!

458
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.600
This is Kouki's Honda.

459
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.980
It's a Ryo-chan who

460
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.300
's not afraid of anything.

461
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.440
If you don't like it, get out

462
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:10.600
of here!

463
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.140
Get out!

464
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.620
What's going on?

465
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.000
Don't fight!

466
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.840
Senpai, we're leaving.

467
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:29.620
Yeah!

468
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.720
Let's go, Honda!

469
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.780
But...

470
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.000
How are we supposed to get out of

471
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.100
here?

472
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.980
Hey, you!

473
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.280
Don't just stand there!

474
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.400
Get in the car!

475
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.260
You imbeciles!

476
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.420
Prepare yourselves!

477
00:19:50.700 --> 00:20:01.360
Let's

478
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:01.460
go!

479
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:01.720
Yeah!

480
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:24.530
Let's

481
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.150
go, Honda!

482
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.980
Welcome!

483
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.170
Welcome!

484
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:51.480
Show me what you

485
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:51.580
've got!

486
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.280
Who are you?

487
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.120
You're the head of the V

488
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.940
iolence Special!

489
00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.840
The head of the Violen

491
00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.340

492
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:13.600
leader!

493
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.440
We've been found out!

494
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:16.800
I see.

495
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.060
So the two of us are the cul

496
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.220
prits of the Sakagura Miss

497
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:20.360

I won't forgive you!

500
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.420
Hey, Kishin!

501
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.580
Damn it!

502
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.560
What are we going to do if we

503
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:32.660
get fired because of Ryoji?

504
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.120
How far are you going to chase me?

505
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.210
There's only one thing you can't

506
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.310
do!

507
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.550
You made me angry!

508
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.490
You're going to pay for this!

509
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.440
We're going to prove our innocence!

510
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.300
We'll be able to ride our bikes

511
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:23.760
again!

512
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.270
Chief!

513
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.030
Ryoji!

514
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.690
Honda!

515
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.370
So it was you guys!

516
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.810
There's a deep reason for this!

517
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.650
I won't forgive you!

518
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.820
Nagagawa!

519
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.800
Act with more emotion!

520
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.760
This is the scene where you reunite

521
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.980
with your mother!

522
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.040
With this, you'll definitely get more views!

523
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.200
Camera, standby, okay!

524
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.460
Let's get to work!

525
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.840
Next time, we'll earn more views!

526
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:21.880
Look forward to it!

527
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:37.390
you
