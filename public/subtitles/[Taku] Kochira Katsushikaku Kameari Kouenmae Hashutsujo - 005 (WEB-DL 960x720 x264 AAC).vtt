00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.780
Summer!

3
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.810
Whole lens cam can capture your

4
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.910
face and movement.

5
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.010
Hurry up and massage your face!

6
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:44.730
Circus of Mukki Summer I

7
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.050
'm so hot from the morning that I

8
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.330
can't do it.

9
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.790
I'd like some shaved ice and strawberries.

10
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.170
Here you are.

11
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.250
Huh?

12
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.030
When did you start using an electric fan?

13
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.850
I've been using it since this year.

14
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.050
Electric fans are easier to use and don

15
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.610
't get in the way.

16
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.530
I'm glad you like it.

17
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.130
That's true.

18
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.970
I was going to throw that away, too.

19
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.990
You're going to throw it away?

20
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.050
What a waste.

21
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.990
You can still use this ice cream m

22
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.090
aker.

23
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.830
Well, it's the flow of the times.

24
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.910
Here you go.

25
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.450
If you don't need it, I'll

26
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.790
take it.

27
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.290
No, thanks.

28
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.370
Ma'am!

29
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.410
Give me an ice cream.

30
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.870
I'll have a melon.

31
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.090
Here you go.

32
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.950
You guys!

33
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.190
If you go out without studying, your mom

34
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.830
will scold you.

35
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.850
Ryo, is it okay for you to

36
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.350
sell oil in a place like this?

37
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.450
I'm not selling oil!

38
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.610
I'm eating ice cream!

39
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.410
Damn it.

40
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.370
These days, even kids say things like a

41
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.570
boss.

42
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.590
I ate it, I ate it.

43
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.510
If you eat something cold, you'll get

44
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.210
hungry and go to bed.

45
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.010
I don't care if I get hungry

46
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.950
and go to sleep.

47
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.950
I'll take it.

48
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.930
Okay.

49
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.710
Hello, workers who are struggling in this hot

50
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.130
hell.

51
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.710
Ryo, what's that?

52
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.370
It's an ice cream maker.

53
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.250
I got it from a candy store.

54
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.530
Ice cream maker?

55
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.430
You get everything you can get, don't

56
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.530
you?

57
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.360
What are you going to do with that?

58
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.080
I'm going to make ice cream.

59
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.320
It's obvious that I'm going to

60
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.580
make ice cream.

61
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.300
In winter, I'll make ice cream with

62
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.620
kotatsu.

63
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.920
In summer, I'll make ice cream with

64
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.900
kakigori.

65
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.420
I can't help it even if I

66
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.260
make katsubushi with this.

67
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Senpai, if you're going to make

68
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.880
ice cream...

69
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.820
There's this Penkichi-kun

70
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.860
that Ryo-chan bought at the

71
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.960
supermarket last week.

72
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.580
Pen!

73
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.080
You can't do something like that!

74
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.520
In this gourmet era, kakig

75
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.020
ori has to be real.

76
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.400
I wonder if kakigori has

77
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.900
something authentic.

78
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.340
It changes depending on the time and place.

79
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.880
Last week, you were showing off this k

80
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.100
akigori machine.

81
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.720
I'll make it right away.

82
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.560
But Ryo-chan, if it's

83
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.800
authentic, you wouldn't use ice from the

84
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.220
fridge, would you?

85
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.839
If it's authentic, you'd have to

86
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.000
use Mont Blanc ice or Antarctic

87
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.500
ice.

88
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.520
Antarctic ice, huh?

89
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.860
There's a Nakagawa Concer

90
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.580
n branch in Greenland.

91
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.380
If it's authentic ice, it'll work.

92
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.140
In that case...

93
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.340
Huh?

94
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.820
Gourmet kakigori is

95
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.960
authentic.

96
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.840
I bought that ice.

97
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.100
Eat it right away.

98
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.680
Okay, but...

99
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.400
Listen, eat it right away.

100
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.680
I hate waiting.

101
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.780
Got it.

102
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.180
Then, take a break.

103
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.100
He gets serious right away.

104
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.510
What is it?

105
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.910
It's so noisy, I can't sleep.

106
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.490
Senpai!

107
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.130
The authentic ice has arrived!

108
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.770
Hurry!

109
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.210
The ice is here!

110
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.450
It's here?

111
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.410
Where's the ice?

112
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.480
One whole gyoza!

113
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.280
Yay!

114
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.760
This is all mine!

115
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.060
Here's 10,000 yen for the ice.

116
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.100
This way!

117
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.280
This way, this way!

118
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.000
That's it!

119
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.200
Yay!

120
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.480
This is worth eating.

121
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.930
I hate this.

122
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.490
It's so hot.

123
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.570
It's terrible to be blown away by

124
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.450
the wind at a time like this.

125
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.990
It's like being blown away by the

126
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.090
snow.

127
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.610
Yeah.

128
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.970
What's that?

129
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.850
It's amazing!

130
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.070
It's a gyoza!

131
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.910
It's an alien!

132
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.210
Anryoku Sankichi It's

133
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.310
delicious!

134
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.060
The shine is different.

135
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.680
Are you done, Ryo-chan?

136
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.060
Can I have some, too?

137
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.060
No.

138
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.500
Why not?

139
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.280
Just a little bit.

140
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.760
It's a precious ice I bought at

141
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.860
the store.

142
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.800
I can't eat it for free.

143
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.880
You're stingy.

144
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.820
Whatever you say, Nakagawa already paid

145
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.820
10,000 yen for it.

146
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.700
The ice is all mine.

147
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.920
You guys look good with the ice in

148
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.020
the fridge.

149
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.140
What a strange sound.

150
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.700
Compared to this, it's a

151
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.800
wonderful sound.

152
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.180
It's like the cry of a sp

153
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.280
arrow.

154
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.300
This is the authentic traditional Japanese shaved ice.

155
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.800
Now, I'll put some syrup on it.

156
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.980
It's done!

157
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.780
The material of the ice looks like a

158
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.920
bubble.

159
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.400
It's delicate and beautiful like a bubble.

160
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.220
I'll have a bite.

161
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.900
It's delicious!

162
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.680
It's different from the original!

163
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.700
And on the other hand, the smell of

164
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.680
water, the smell of the ice, and the

165
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.860
smell of the fridge...

166
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.260
It's really unpleasant.

167
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.760
This is delicious.

168
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.560
It's full of the romance of the

169
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:46.660
Taiko.

170
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:46.920
You have to come out of the cold,

171
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.460
beautiful ice to be born.

172
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.400
The world's finest shaved ice!

173
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.020
No, actually, this should be called shaved ice.

174
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.540
The shaved ice I made in the fridge

175
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.940
is no longer shaved ice.

176
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.460
Until yesterday, you said that the shaved ice

177
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.000
you made was the best.

178
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.840
That's right.

179
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.480
This time, I'll make it with milk.

180
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.100
Take that!

181
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.280
Don't steal the ice without permission!

182
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.600
You're under arrest!

183
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.840
Just a little bit is fine.

184
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.580
Thanks to this ice, I can clean up

185
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.120
the hot traffic.

186
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.440
Look!

187
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.420
The car is honking!

188
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.740
Hurry up and get to work!

189
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.919
Ah, you're so stingy.

190
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.740
It's delicious!

191
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.919
Mm, it's beautiful.

192
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.660
It's delicious!

193
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.720
It's really delicious!

194
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.700
It's just like a gourmet shaved

195
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.080
ice!

196
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.060
I want you guys to eat it, too.

197
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.960
I'm really sorry that you're satisfied

198
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.060
with that kind of shaved ice.

199
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.120
The shine of this elegant ice and the

200
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.400
mildness of the kiwi...

201
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.660
The sound of the ice popping is like

202
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:18.520
the whisper of Venus, Mm, it's

203
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.040
fantastic!

204
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.320
This world is a paradise!

205
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.140
I'm going to boil it down!

206
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.280
I'm going to boil it down!

207
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.480
The inside of my mouth is numb from

208
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.320
the coldness.

209
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.500
But when it comes to the 70th

210
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.300
cup, I'm a little...

211
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:36.800
Aren't you tired?

212
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.760
It's about time.

213
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.960
That's not true!

214
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.060
Is this what you call a good shave

215
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.240
d ice?

216
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.480
It's cold, isn't it?

217
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.300
Take that!

218
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.520
It's dangerous, so move over here!

219
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.420
It feels good, doesn't it?

220
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.300
Damn it!

221
00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.560
Hey!

222
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.520
It's my ice!

223
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.720
Don't just stick to it!

224
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.260
I paid for it with my own money!

225
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.960
It's my one week's worth of

226
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.220
food!

227
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.380
It's a delicious big portion!

228
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.300
The strawberry flavor and the milk topping are

229
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:17.580
the best!

230
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.620
If I eat it all at once, I

231
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:25.900
'll get a headache!

232
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.800
Are you all right, Senpai?

233
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:32.900
Don't push yourself!

234
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.760
Did you give it to a neighbor?

235
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680
What is this?

236
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.300
If you think this is just water, you

237
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:39.960
can drink as much as you want!

238
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.760
Two-thirds of a human body is

239
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.040
water!

240
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.700
I didn't know I still had this

241
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.700
much left...

242
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.580
All right!

243
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.380
I have a special service for you!

244
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.540
I'll give you this shaved ice!

245
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.900
I already ate it, so it's fine.

246
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.820
That's right!

247
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.580
I don't want it!

248
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.220
You take responsibility, Ryo-chan!

249
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.400
All right!

250
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.580
I'll eat it all!

251
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.500
I'll eat it all at once!

252
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.320
What are you going to do?

253
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.440
It's obvious, isn't it?

254
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.560
I'm going to eat it!

255
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.860
I'm tired of the strawberry flavor and

256
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.360
the milk topping!

257
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:20.520
I'm tired of the strawberry flavor and

258
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.400
the milk topping!

259
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.540
I'll put some coke on this side,

260
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.120
and some ketchup on the other.

261
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.540
I'll put some egg, natto, and

262
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.220
a vitamin drink on this side.

263
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.460
How does it look?

264
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.020
Doesn't it look delicious?

265
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.560
Are you really going to eat it?

266
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.620
Of course!

267
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.340
If you keep eating, you'll get a

268
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:41.560
headache.

269
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:41.900
You'll get hurt.

270
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.900
It's getting cold.

271
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.320
I'll drink some tea to warm up.

272
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.260
All right, I'm warmed up.

273
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.940
I can't eat any more.

274
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.300
What are you going to do with the

275
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.400
rest?

276
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.660
I'll eat it later.

277
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.360
What's this?

278
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.380
Ryo, did you do it again?

279
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.420
What?

280
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.880
I didn't do anything.

281
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:26.960
You idiot!

282
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.140
Come here!

283
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.000
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

284
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.160
My ears are going to stretch!

285
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.120
What's this ice?

286
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.780
That's a phone call.

287
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:35.740
What?

288
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.280
This is...

289
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.380
It's a stage set I prepared for

290
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:42.480
you.

291
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.540
It's for me?

292
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.420
Yes, it is.

293
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.800
I was thinking of having you sing the

294
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.480
song, Ryu-hyo-nag

295
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.980
are-tabi, which you're good

296
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.300
at, at the karaoke.

297
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.920
Don't try to fool me!

298
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.860
This is ice from the North Pole, R

299
00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.440
yo-chan bought it from Kei

300
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.620
-chan for 10,000 yen.

301
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.140
Ryo-tsu!

302
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.620
Would you like a drink, Chief?

303
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.260
I don't need it!

304
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.740
Get rid of this ice!

305
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.280
Get rid of this ice!

306
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.620
Do you hear me?

307
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.260
Do you hear me?

308
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.460
Shut up!

309
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.980
If you don't get rid of this

310
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.680
ice by tomorrow, you'll be transferred to

311
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.640
the North Pole Emergency Department.

312
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.840
There's such a thing as the North

313
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.720
Pole Emergency Department?

314
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.600
I'll make it special for you.

315
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.060
Do you understand, Ryo-tsu?

316
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.260
There's still a lot of ice left.

317
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.620
I can't eat it all today.

318
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.260
Oh, this is it?

319
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.860
The ice Ryo-san bought?

320
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.200
It's the real North Pole ice.

321
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.880
If it stands out this much, it'll

322
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.160
be a big deal.

323
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.000
What are you going to do with all

324
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.400
this ice?

325
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.440
I was going to make shaved ice out

326
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.000
of it and eat it all.

327
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.360
Shaved ice?

328
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.040
If you make shaved ice out of all

329
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.940
this ice, you can even ski.

330
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.720
That's it!

331
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.520
That's it!

332
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.300
I'll ski in this hot summer heat!

333
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.900
This is going to be fun!

334
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.700
Rental skiing, rental snowboarding, and even

335
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.000
golf!

336
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.180
I'll make a lot of money and

337
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.980
get rid of all the ice.

338
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.660
It's going to be a great day!

339
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.120
All right, let's get started!

340
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.180
Let's do it!

341
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.640
Even if I break this hand!

342
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.920
Senpai, what are you going to do

343
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.160
this time?

344
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.140
It's true that money is involved.

345
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.680
Ryo-chan's source of power

346
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.820
is money.

347
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.580
Good work!

348
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.260
Carry the rest!

349
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.900
All right, Ryo-san!

350
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.760
Leave it to me!

351
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.540
Once you've set up the scaffolding,

352
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.340
the next step is the seat!

353
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.340
Okay!

354
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.020
This is going to be a piece of

355
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.120
cake!

356
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.220
This is going to be a piece of

357
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:44.320
cake!

358
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.240
Now the road is clear.

359
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.900
I wonder what Kankichi is doing

360
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.000
with all this ice.

361
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.160
We're almost there.

362
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.260
We're almost there.

363
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.280
Ryo-san!

364
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.500
I brought a ski and a snowboard!

365
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.520
All right!

366
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.340
Leave them there!

367
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:19.620
Okay!

368
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:26.720
All right!

369
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.120
We're ready to go!

370
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.620
We did a pretty good job!

371
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.760
Come on in!

372
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.760
Ryo-tsu Snowland!

373
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
We're about to open!

374
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.240
What's Ryo-tsu Snow

375
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.500
land?

376
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.080
Come on in!

377
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:42.300
Come on in!

378
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:42.580
It's snowing in the middle of

379
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:42.860
summer!

380
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.080
It's a desert-like city!

381
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.160
It's the Karuizawa of

382
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:48.260
the lower cities!

383
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.560
This is the only place in the middle

384
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.880
of summer where you can enjoy skiing, snow

385
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.460
boarding, and even playing bobsleigh!

386
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.240
Come on in!

387
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.680
Come on in!

388
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.780
Let's go in!

389
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:58.980
Yeah!

390
00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.600
It looks fun!

391
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.840
Me too!

392
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.740
Me too!

393
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.319
The traffic jam has been resolved, but there

394
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.079
's still a long way to go.

395
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.400
Yes, yes.

396
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.020
Here's the rent.

397
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.960
You're not allowed to bring anything in.

398
00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.640
Here, 30% for the group.

399
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.000
30% for the kids, the girls, the

400
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.140
grandpas, and the grandmas.

401
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.200
Now, how about it?

402
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.359
That snowboard.

403
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.339
Yes, yes.

404
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.079
Welcome, welcome.

405
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.359
Here you go.

406
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:27.960
Thank you.

407
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.200
This is going to be worth a few

408
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.760
million yen.

409
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.500
That's right.

410
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.340
Let's put it up for sale.

411
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.720
Let's put it up for sale.

412
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.700
Come on, come on, come on.

413
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.880
If you're hungry, this is Snowland

414
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.160
's specialty, the ice sushi.

415
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.660
It's a dish that makes your parents

416
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.140
happy.

417
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.820
It's the kids' favorite, the omelet.

418
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.140
If you don't eat this, there's

419
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.400
no point in coming here.

420
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.680
Then I'll take one.

421
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.360
I'll take one.

422
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.200
I'll take one.

423
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.740
Okay, I'll take one.

424
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.720
I'll take one.

425
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.100
Wait a minute.

426
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.580
The rice part is shaved ice.

427
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.520
That's right.

428
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.960
It's cold, so it lasts a long

429
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.160
time.

430
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.980
How do you eat it?

431
00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.540
Like this.

432
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.700
You dip it in jam and eat it.

433
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.700
It's refreshing.

434
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.040
Jam and sushi.

435
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.160
If you don't like raw food, how

436
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.540
about an ice curry that even Indians will

437
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:21.640
be surprised at?

438
00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.740
Welcome.

439
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.840
Even the curry is ice?

440
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.320
I want that.

441
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.760
Let's go to the curry.

442
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.640
I can still eat as much as I

443
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:32.740
want.

444
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.100
I'll give you the stuff I dropped.

445
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.720
If you don't like it, I'll

446
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.440
give you a car and a ball.

447
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.360
I'll give you a small

448
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.800
picture.

449
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.500
Give me an old man.

450
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.620
Me too.

451
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:50.540
Me too.

452
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.700
Don't push me.

453
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.400
Five balls are 200 yen.

454
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.440
Give me five.

455
00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.380
Ten more.

456
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.420
Ten more.

457
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.620
It's already sold out.

458
00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.640
I can't keep up with this business.

459
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.060
What?

460
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.220
What did you say?

461
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.180
You have a dormitory?

462
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.240
He makes a snow land in the park

463
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.540
and gathers customers.

464
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.280
He rents skis and snowboards

465
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.260
and earns money.

466
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.460
What a guy.

467
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.400
I have it.

468
00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.580
If you make so much money, would you

469
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.020
like to buy another mountain?

470
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.060
Ryosuke.

471
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.710
What is it, chief?

472
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.930
I heard you're making money by making

473
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.030
this stuff in the park.

474
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.130
It's nothing.

475
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.250
I don't just deal with the ice.

476
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.190
I want to make a place where I

477
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.630
can interact with the local people.

478
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.650
I just want you to be happy.

479
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.010
That's all.

480
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.590
Then what is this?

481
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.830
Ryosuke.

482
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.790
I know you have money behind you.

483
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.110
Give it back to everyone right now.

484
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.110
No.

485
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.190
Wait.

486
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.990
Time out.

487
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.110
Time out.

488
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.770
Wait.

489
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.350
It went well.

490
00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.230
Don't take it.

491
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.690
There are eggs, too.

492
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.050
Wasabi.

493
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.250
Wait.

494
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.950
Wait.

495
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.010
Wait.

496
00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.870
Don't do that.

497
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.950
It hurts.

498
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:05.670
Wait.

499
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.780
It hurts.

500
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.240
Watch out.

501
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:15.340
It hurts.

502
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.560
Damn it.

503
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:24.820
It's mine.

504
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.180
I won't give it to anyone.

505
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.540
This guy.

506
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.990
Prepare yourself, Ryosuke.

507
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.270
I won't let you do that.

508
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.510
You're too naive.

509
00:21:53.410 --> 00:22:00.530
It's collapsing.

510
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.750
What's

511
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:15.730
that?

512
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.710
What's that?

513
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.270
Where did everyone go?

514
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.710
It's time to go home.

515
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.010
Ryosuke.

516
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.910
It's strange.

517
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.230
There's no one here.

518
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.230
Chief.

519
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.930
Help me.

520
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.430
What?

521
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.490
I protected it.

522
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.090
Give this money back to everyone.

523
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.750
No.

524
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.230
It's mine.

525
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.090
Chief.

526
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.250
That's good.

527
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:42.730
Use all the ice.

528
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.210
He's a stingy man who uses

529
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.950
up all his own money.

530
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.390
I wonder if that's his nature.

531
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.430
Shut up!

532
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.490
To

533
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:16.740
be

534
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.720
continued.

535
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.400
Reiko Ikari no Dai Tsu

536
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.660
i Heki Yoroshiku Nan!

537
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Z

538
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.360
edopp.
