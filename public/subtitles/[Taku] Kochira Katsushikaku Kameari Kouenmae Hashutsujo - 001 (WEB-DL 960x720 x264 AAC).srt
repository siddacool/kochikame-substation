has come, has come, has come, has come

has come, has come, has come, has come

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,740
Here it comes!

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,240
You're pretty fired up this morning, Ryo-san!

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm late!

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,700
I can't believe you stopped me here.

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,860
What's with the nervousness?

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
Get out of the way!

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,300
Get out of the way!

58
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,280
Get out of the way!

59
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,260
No way!

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,560
Wait!

61
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,800
"Batsumatsu Police Officer: Ryotsu Arawaru"

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,360
"Batsumatsu Police Officer: Ryotsu Arawaru"

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:27,040
Thanks, Mr. Ryo!

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,500
Hey, that's Ryo-san!

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
50 km/h!

80 km/h!

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,020
The過去メーカー is entering the 10,000 rpm red zone!

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,100
90° hang on!

71
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,980
This is terrible!

72
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,120
Oh, no!

73
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,660
The future is in your hands!

74
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,160
I did it!

75
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,660
I made it in time!

76
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,400
I made it in time!

77
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,340
I made it in time!

78
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
I'm glad that you made it!

79
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,040
It's not good, Ryo.

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,980
The glass broke, and the chief will be mad at me again.

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
Hey, Ryo.

82
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,320
I watered that flower every day, and it finally bloomed.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,060
I won't forgive you if you touch it again.

84
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,640
He's as noisy as ever.

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,180
What? The chief hasn't come yet.

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,560
It's not like that.

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,780
It's not like that.

88
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,720
You know, people who stand on people's feet

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,300
always come 30 minutes earlier.

90
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,720
R-Ryo!

91
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,020
What's wrong, Terai?

92
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:21,460
What's wrong, Terai?

93
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,740
Chief!

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,680
Yes, Chief.

95
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,460
You're good at this.

96
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,220
It's my honor to leave the countryside

97
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,540
and spend two and a half hours on the plane.

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm proud of you.

99
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,700
You can see that

100
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,120
in not only how three of us work,

101
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,280
You idiot!

102
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,500
You're too unreasonable.

103
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,740
Every day this day,

104
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,680
the police are slow,

105
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,740
so you'll find me here

106
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,400
and appreciate my figurative skills.

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,100
You idiot!

108
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,420
You idiot!

109
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,740
Even if you're a bachelor, you do the same as the children's university entrance exam.

110
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,800
How many exams do you have to write to get a degree?

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Are you planning to get into the Guinness Book of Records?

112
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
That's why you don't have a wife.

113
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,200
Live your life more seriously.

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,860
There's a song like this in my favorite Suizenji Kiyoko's song.

115
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,700
One step a day, three steps in three days,

116
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,200
three steps forward, two steps back.

117
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,420
This is it!

118
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,300
Here, here, here!

119
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,260
Suizenji Kiyoko, the chief's box!

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,080
That's it, that's it!

121
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,520
Three steps forward, two steps back.

122
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,500
One step forward, two steps back.

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,440
I was a fool to teach you how to be modest about life.

124
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,100
My head hurts.

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,580
It's finally over.

126
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,260
I was stupid for the second time.

127
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,180
You know,

128
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,160
I remember one stupid thing.

129
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,440
Chief!

130
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,980
Did you forget something?

131
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,860
That's right.

132
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,120
Today was my payday.

133
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,880
I don't want to do it to you, but I can't help it.

134
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,100
Listen, Ryozu.

135
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,260
Don't use it right away because you have money.

136
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,720
Think about the future.

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Use it in a planned manner.

138
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,080
Yes.

139
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,220
Oh, Ryozu.

140
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,920
Just play fishing and lead the ship and that's that.

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,660
Right.

142
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,300
Let's go in and find a new machine.

143
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
Here, Ryozu.

144
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,800
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,800
You're in the shoes and excited,

146
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,320
so you can cooling it down quickly.

147
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,380
Yeah.

148
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,020
A machine running here?

149
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,380
Rocco-kun, where did you get that from?

150
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,140
I'm here to get your bonus.

151
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,660
Ugh! Everyone at the shopping street is here!

152
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,440
Crap! If this keeps up...

153
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,320
Run!

154
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,160
Corona!

155
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,660
C-Captain!

156
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,820
Derai! Hold both of their legs!

157
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,200
Y-Yes!

158
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,540
Let go! Let go!

159
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,500
Derai! You're not getting away!

160
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,600
Now, everyone, please take him away!

161
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,740
Let go!

162
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,680
It's not bad, Ryo.

163
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,940
Game software and Plumdive, 38,000 yen.

164
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,460
I'll take it.

165
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,480
Ramen is 21,000 yen.

166
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,860
Beer and whiskey, 28,000 yen.

167
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,980
Oh, it's a bit too much.

168
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,660
Beer is 18,000 yen.

169
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,180
Zurizao is 3,000 yen.

170
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,760
Seriously?

171
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,460
What?

172
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,140
3,000 yen.

173
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,820
Bye!

174
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,020
150 yen.

175
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
That's all for this month?

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,860
You're so selfish.

177
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,960
That's why I said you had to live a healthy life.

178
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,480
Captain!

179
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,160
Don't make a fool of yourself!

180
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,680
Be a man and live a month, that's all.

181
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,220
No!

182
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
Don't lend money to Ryo, Derai or Reiko.

183
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,000
I have a house loan to pay for my house.

184
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,260
It's fine.

185
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,180
You can live with just that.

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,260
Yeah, don't be so sweet.

187
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,220
I'll pay you back for both.

188
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,780
Captain.

189
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,360
Don't say that.

190
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,300
50,000 yen.

191
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,480
No, 30,000 yen is fine.

192
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Then 20,000 yen.

193
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,120
10,000 yen.

194
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,820
At least 1,000 yen.

195
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,060
No!

196
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,240
Keiji!

197
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,220
I won't cry to anyone anymore.

198
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,040
If you're going to cry to such cold people,

199
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,940
you'd better die!

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,680
You said it.

201
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,860
Don't forget what you said.

202
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm not sure you'll be able to make it anyway.

203
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,140
I'm going to send you a happy,

204
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,480
meaningful life for 150 yen!

205
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,420
Kids' fights, aren't they?

206
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:56,840
Yeah.

207
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,300
"I'm dying to be a full-time worker!"

208
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,820
"I'm dying to be a full-time worker!"

209
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,160
"I'm dying to be a full-time worker!"

210
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,660
My watch is gone.

211
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,340
That was a good name.

212
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,180
There's no Reiko.

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:32,600
How about we have a lunch together?

214
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,000
It hurts!

215
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,640
Ryo-chan, you should have died from the fire.

216
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,000
Who said that?

217
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,420
Damn! I was reading the pattern.

218
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,760
Damn! Give me your bed!

219
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,940
No! This is mine!

220
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,900
Ryo-chan, you're stealing other people's things.

221
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,840
Shut up! The name is written on the rice grain!

222
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,600
Give it to me!

223
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,340
Ryo-chan, stop it!

224
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,220
Give it to me!

225
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,160
No!

226
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:39,900
Ryo-chan!

227
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,960
This is what you get for being a good boy!

228
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,680
You're amazing when it comes to the rice grain.

229
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,120
Damn!

230
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,160
Damn!

231
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,700
Damn!

232
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,540
Damn!

233
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,520
Damn!

234
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Damn!

235
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,280
Damn!

236
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,780
Damn!

237
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,460
Damn!

238
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,920
Why am I so hungry, eh?

239
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Do they have any food?

240
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,920
Oh, I found something.

241
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,460
I found this "Kagami Mochi".

242
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,540
Alright. This must contain something edible.

243
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,080
Hmm...

244
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,860
I'll have some ponzu.

245
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,860
Ah, too much.

246
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,540
That's too much. This is too sour.

247
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,700
I'll add salt and add it to my mouth.

248
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,360
I added too much of anything.

249
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,080
I'll add sugar.

250
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,260
Well, it's fine. It's this much.

251
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,460
I'll season it with tonkatsu sauce.

252
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,380
The mass-produced hot pot is complete!

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,940
The Shogatsu Kagami mochi is left.

254
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,320
What? Isn't that the one that got really moldy?

255
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,420
No, it's not.

256
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,300
You're stupid.

257
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,900
Mushrooms are also a kind of hair.

258
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,880
It has a lot of aji-sai leaves.

259
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,840
It's a perfect balance of nutrition.

260
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,540
Eating aji-sai leaves?

261
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,300
It's called aji-sai, so it's got a good taste.

262
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,600
The color is not good.

263
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,860
Ryo! That's Reiko's...

264
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,040
Color is important in cooking.

265
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
Thank you for the meal!

266
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,740
Ryo?

267
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,320
What are you doing?

268
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,360
I told you not to touch it again!

269
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,800
You bastard!

270
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,420
Damn it.

271
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,300
Leave some for me, you jerk.

272
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm hungry.

273
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,200
What's this?

274
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,260
There!

275
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,300
There!

276
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,220
Isn't that Junpei and Kappei from the tofu shop?

277
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,160
Junpei, you're the best!

278
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
You can do it, Junpei!

279
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,360
Junpei, you're the best!

280
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,860
Junpei, you're the best!

281
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,760
Junpei, you're the best!

282
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,680
No, no, no, no.

283
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,540
You're doing a good job, sir.

284
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,880
You're quite good at cooking.

285
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,260
The octopus looks delicious.

286
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,620
Junpei, how about you compete with me?

287
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,040
With Ryo?

288
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,480
That's right.

289
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,340
We'll have a one-on-one game.

290
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,580
If I win, you'll get this octopus.

291
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,640
What if Ryo loses?

292
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,560
You'll get your favorite stuff,

293
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,460
and I'll give you this.

294
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,420
What?

295
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,080
You're playing?

296
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,900
What do you say?

297
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,440
Are you ready, Junpei?

298
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,720
Yes.

299
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,280
Let's see who wins the first round of the game!

300
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,840
Let's see who wins the first round of the game!

301
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,820
It's busy.

302
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
Oh, Ryo.

303
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,460
I won!

304
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,280
With a score of one million and nine hundred and eighty points,

305
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,940
you're pretty good.

306
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,540
You're pretty good.

307
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,380
It's my turn next.

308
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,460
Start!

309
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,180
Triss-sart!

310
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,800
Kurenai Idareuchi!

311
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,720
I'm screwed!

312
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,780
Aimei Uchi!

313
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,880
Kurenai Uchi!

314
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,180
I won!

315
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,760
Awesome!

316
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,660
What do you think?

317
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,000
I lost.

318
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,720
You should have stopped, Big Brother.

319
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,200
As promised, I'll take the Takoyaki.

320
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,760
Oh no!

321
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,560
Huh?

322
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,080
Junpei!

323
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,500
You bastard!

324
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,280
Are you ok?

325
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,460
Ryo!

326
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,020
Hey!

327
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,860
This is bad!

328
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,960
Wait!

329
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,940
Stop!

330
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,200
Wait!

331
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,920
It's dangerous!

332
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,560
What?

333
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,020
Uraaaaaaaaaaa!

334
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,940
The bicycle is going to get tired...

335
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,640
Ultra Power Turbo On!

336
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,080
Yosu!

337
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,380
Yata! They are chasing me with bicycles!

338
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,920
I'm not going to let you catch me.

339
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,020
I'll catch you if you let me.

340
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,820
Are you serious?

341
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm not letting you get away!

342
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm not letting you get away!

343
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,060
You bastard!

344
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,180
Alright, let's get this over with!

345
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,460
Missile Jump!

346
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,300
Missile Jump!

347
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,960
Missile Jump!

348
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,900
Missile Jump!

349
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,360
Missile Jump!

350
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,360
Missile Jump!

351
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,080
Damn it! It's a shortcut!

352
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,940
What are you doing, Ryo-san?

353
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,020
Zuma, the mine is being destroyed!

354
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
Oh no!

355
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,020
Missile Jump!

356
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,080
Missile Jump!

357
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,760
Missile Jump!

358
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,560
Missile Jump!

359
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:16,840
Missile Jump!

360
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,620
Missile Jump!

361
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,160
Missile Jump!

362
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,100
Missile Jump!

363
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,820
Missile Jump!

364
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:22,980
Missile Jump!

365
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,260
Missile Jump!

366
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,680
Missile Jump!

367
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,800
Get back here!

368
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,100
I'm on the boat!

369
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,400
They're still after us! Hurry up!

370
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,940
They're so stubborn!

371
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,920
Don't underestimate me!

372
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,740
They're still after us at 80km/h!

373
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,940
Hurry up!

374
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,060
Move, you idiot!

375
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,820
Looks like he finally gave up.

376
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,780
No way!

377
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,120
Wait, you idiot!

378
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,180
He's a monster!

379
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,080
No way!

380
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,600
He's not following us!

381
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,880
Well done, Ken-chan.

382
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,220
Well done, Ken-chan.

383
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:27,220
That's it! The exit!

384
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,100
Take this!

385
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,120
Take this!

386
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,260
No!

387
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:31,680
No!

388
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,540
Then we've held him captive.

389
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,120
Brilliant.

390
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,800
You bastard!

391
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,940
Yes?

392
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,100
Sorry, I won't do it again.

393
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,240
Give me back my takoyaki!

394
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,200
My takoyaki! Give me back my takoyaki!

395
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,560
You did it, Ryo.

396
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,300
It's been 8 years since I've been a criminal, congratulations.

397
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,700
Congratulations.

398
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,220
Well, I was a criminal for a while, but I've been a criminal for a while.

399
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,320
A criminal is a criminal, right?

400
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
You don't look like one, Ryo.

401
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,480
Ryo!

402
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Hey, Junpei.

403
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,000
Are you done with your legs?

404
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,460
That's a big deal!

405
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,160
Ryo, I'm sure you'll win the game next time.

406
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,920
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,340
You should practice hard, Junpei.

408
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,280
Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything yet.

409
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
Oh, yeah.

410
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,340
That driver was a traffic criminal with a sign.

411
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,440
This is probably a special award, a gold medal.

412
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,480
A gold medal?

413
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,200
Yay!

414
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,560
I'll be saved this month!

415
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,260
Ryo, are you there?

416
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,140
Uh-oh.

417
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,020
Yes!

418
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,060
Here is the great police officer of Kameari, Ryo Kankichi, who arrested the criminal Atene-han.

419
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,500
You're going to pay me a gold medal, right?

420
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,640
You idiot!

421
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,960
Look outside!

422
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,900
Ryo!

423
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,760
I heard you caused trouble for your neighbors again.

424
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,600
You'll be fined from next month's salary!

425
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,260
N-no!

426
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,940
Please forgive me, I'm so sorry!

427
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,840
Next time on Kameari Kouen-mai

428
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,780
wrath to the central police

429
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:07,820
The police officer came to Kameari Park,

430
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,360
the new police officer is the only son of Nakagawa family.

431
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,440
How can the police officer be a chauffeur in this cattle market?

432
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,360
Next time, the new policemen from the sky, welcome

433
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,780
Thank you for watching!

434
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,060
Please smile, you're not bad

435
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,820
Please smile, you're still the same

436
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,340
Always smile

437
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:14,140
Because a woman in dark clothes isn't pretty

438
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,840
I should smile right away

439
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,340
Please smile, you're not bad

440
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,780
Because a woman in dark clothes isn't pretty

441
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:43,800
I should smile right away
