00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:16.660
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) The summer

2
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.280
has come again this year.

3
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.160
The summer has come again this year.

4
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.960
A big wave is coming.

5
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.700
A big chest is coming.

6
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.020
The summer has come again this year.

7
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.940
The summer has come again this year.

8
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.640
A big wave is coming.

9
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.320
A big butt is coming.

10
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920
A big chest is coming.

11
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:20.120
A big chest is coming.

12
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.900
A new day has come from the sky.

13
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.860
The weather is good.

14
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.280
Something good will happen on a day like

15
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.380
this.

16
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.220
It's quiet.

17
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.580
It's too quiet.

18
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.340
That means...

19
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.660
I'm going to be late again.

20
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.440
I have a sudden job.

21
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.180
I came two hours before my work hours.

22
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.520
I've been like this for a long

23
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.620
time.

24
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.039
We were talking about whether it would rain.

25
00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.380
We were talking about whether it would rain.

26
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.220
I'm very impressed right now.

27
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.160
I've been a police officer for 30

28
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.100
years.

29
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.840
I've never been so happy.

30
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.040
Mr. Vice President.

31
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.040
You don't have to be so impressed.

32
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.620
Ryo-tsu has finally w

33
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.760
oken up to his job.

34
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.560
All the hard work so far has been

35
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.060
rewarded.

36
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.780
All right, it's done.

37
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.480
You're great, Ryo-tsu.

38
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.720
I thought you'd do it someday.

39
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
By the way, what document were you writing?

40
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.440
What document?

41
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.080
I don't like it.

42
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.500
Did you forget, Mr. Vice President?

43
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.920
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

44
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.540
I told you to submit a pile of

45
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.920
paperwork.

46
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.300
P-Paperwork?

47
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.220
I wrote it all down.

48
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.920
The fire has stopped.

49
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.800
You idiot!

50
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.820
Fireball!

51
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.100
How dare you!

52
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.540
Mr. Vice President, are you all right?

53
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.840
I'm sorry, but I need medicine.

54
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.080
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.880
Are you drinking too much, Mr. Vice President?

56
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.600
You're getting old.

57
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.860
You have to drink moderately.

58
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.200
What did you say?

59
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.940
It's all your fault!

60
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.280
Mr. Vice President, calm down.

61
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100
If you get too angry, you'll

62
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.300
lose your temper.

63
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.100
I had such a useless subordinate, but

64
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.080
I had no choice but to give up.

65
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.960
I remembered as a subordinate.

66
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.080
Is Nakagawa still not here?

67
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.600
Mr. Nakagawa?

68
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.880
He's a newcomer who's going

69
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.440
to come to this dispatch office today.

70
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.720
What kind of guy is he?

71
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.480
Oh, he's pretty handsome.

72
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.280
He was raised in New York until he

73
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.380
was 16.

74
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.480
I see.

75
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.660
He's the same age as you, Re

76
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.840
iko.

77
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.300
Yes.

78
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.200
His car has a permanent license.

79
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.780
He also has a boat and an airplane

80
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.240
license.

81
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.460
He's also athletic and good at martial

82
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.640
arts.

83
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.460
He's so good at shooting that he

84
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.820
can blow the head of a needle a

85
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.920
kilometer away.

86
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.220
Who is this Nakagawa guy?

87
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.040
He's the benefactor of the Nak

88
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.760
agawa Foundation.

89
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.700
The Nakagawa Foundation?

90
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.880
Is it the Nakagawa Foundation, which

91
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.980
is one of the top five foundations in

92
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.080
the world?

93
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.180
That's right.

94
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.300
What is that Nakagawa Foundation?

95
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.280
Is it a financial institution?

96
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.060
It's not a financial institution, it's

97
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.380
a foundation.

98
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.680
It's a conglomerate.

99
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.560
Oh, it's a conglomerate.

100
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.580
Oops.

101
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.440
No, it's not.

102
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.300
Reiko.

103
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.860
Don't talk to such a fool.

104
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.860
You're going to hurt your ears like

105
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.960
me.

106
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.880
Yes.

107
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.100
There's no way I'm going to

108
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.460
give you such a hard job as a

109
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.160
police officer.

110
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.300
I'm the one who doesn't

111
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.580
say goodbye right away.

112
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.660
So, Ryotsu.

113
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.680
Don't let that happen.

114
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.600
You're going to be Nakagawa

115
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.160
Shido.

116
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.400
What?

117
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.130
All right, now.

118
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.830
What do you think?

119
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.110
It's amazing, isn't it?

120
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.350
It's the combat rescue type of the

121
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.450
US military helicopter Black Hawk.

122
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.030
Akira.

123
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.210
I'm tired.

124
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.550
Is that what you were doing yesterday when

125
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.250
you skipped work?

126
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.130
Well, well.

127
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.530
If the president finds out, he'll definitely

128
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.930
be on the lookout.

129
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.790
Let's see.

130
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.410
That's strange.

131
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.510
What the hell is a strop?

132
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.690
What's with that locker?

133
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.830
That's right.

134
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.590
I remember!

135
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.370
Oh, when did you get such a hidden

136
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.590
bag?

137
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.690
What's that?

138
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.790
Huh?

139
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.690
You didn't know?

140
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.370
It's completely made private.

141
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.170
Good, good.

142
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.090
There you go.

143
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.430
Good boy.

144
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.730
Anyway, why did you make it like this?

145
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.490
You could have used this passion for your

146
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.770
job.

147
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.050
You always use it, don't you?

148
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.970
Sorry, sorry.

149
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.670
Ryo?

150
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.030
What's going on?

151
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.790
Are you all right, Ryo?

152
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.910
I thought I was going to die.

153
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.490
By the way, where's the helicopter?

154
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.270
Helicopter?

155
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.470
Huh?

156
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.610
It flew away.

157
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.610
What?

158
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.450
I paid 30,000 yen for it!

159
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.870
I'll get it fixed when it's

160
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.970
gone.

161
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.510
I'm not kidding.

162
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.210
It's Ryo's fault, isn't

163
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.310
it?

164
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.330
Damn it.

165
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.370
Where did it go?

166
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.050
Oh, it's an excellent helicopter.

167
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.650
It brought a friend with it.

168
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.150
Damn it!

169
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.970
How dare you take my helicopter!

170
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.170
Ryo!

171
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.390
What's going on?

172
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.970
What's going on?

173
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.070
The helicopter's heading this way.

174
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.030
What?

175
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.770
What's that?

176
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.550
Damn it!

177
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.550
Who the hell are you?

178
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.660
It's a nuclear bomb!

179
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.340
Yahoo!

180
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:04.280
I'm sorry I'm late.

181
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.820
I'm Keiichi Nakagawa.

182
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.700
I'll be working at this launch site

183
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.640
from today.

184
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.520
Nice to meet you.

185
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.880
How dare you take my helicopter!

186
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.760
Oh!

187
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.380
It's a Walser MPL

188
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.260
submachine gun!

189
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.000
Do you recognize it?

190
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.340
I'm so happy.

191
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.820
By the way, this is the gun.

192
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.740
Oh!

193
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.720
It's the same one as Dirty

194
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.080
Harry!

195
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.660
That movie was amazing, wasn't it?

196
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.240
Yeah, that movie.

197
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.360
Oh, if you don't mind, I'd

198
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.039
like to apologize for destroying your helicopter.

199
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.860
Really?

200
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.080
I'm sorry about that.

201
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.240
Not at all.

202
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.559
We still have a lot of them at

203
00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:39.659
home.

204
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.020
Would you like to come and see them

205
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.120
next time?

206
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.240
Yeah, I'd love to.

207
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:43.880
You idiot!

208
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.540
What the hell are you thinking?

209
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.760
I'm going to sue you!

210
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.120
I'm going to sue you!

211
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.120
So, you don't like this one either?

212
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.580
Of course I do.

213
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.600
Terai, go get him.

214
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.200
Yes, sir.

215
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.760
It's getting dark again.

216
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.840
I'm going to see a doctor, Re

217
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:07.980
iko.

218
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.500
I'll leave the rest to you.

219
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.080
You're a pretty good-looking guy.

220
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.860
I'm Ryotsu.

221
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:15.820
Nice to meet you.

222
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.040
Oh!

223
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.660
You're that super famous Ryotsu?

224
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.880
Nice to meet you, too.

225
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.440
Nice to meet you, too.

226
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.880
You two look like mischievous kids.

227
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.800
You look pretty happy, though.

228
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.280
Huh?

229
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.540
That helicopter's for the police?

230
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.800
You're pretty rich for a konjac

231
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.020
shop.

232
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.300
A konjac shop?

233
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.980
By the way, why did you become a

234
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.760
police officer, Mr. Nakagawa?

235
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.240
Well...

236
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.280
I lived in New York for a long

237
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.680
time, where there was a lot of crime.

238
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.740
I've always wanted to be a police

239
00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:02.280
officer, And you're wearing a pretty flashy

240
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.780
uniform.

241
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.060
Huh?

242
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.160
Yeah.

243
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.100
I think it's more of a problem

244
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.800
than a gun.

245
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.580
Is that so?

246
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.520
Japanese police uniforms aren't very good, so

247
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.980
I made an order in Armani.

248
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.440
I think it was about a million yen.

249
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.840
A million yen?

250
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.680
I don't think you'd spend that

251
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.800
kind of money on a plain uniform.

252
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.320
I don't think you'd spend 300,

253
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.360
000 yen on a radio.

254
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.880
Let's do it together.

255
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.780
Yes, yes.

256
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.880
But you know what?

257
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.160
I haven't been to the shop lately,

258
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.620
but you've been working hard to get

259
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.060
that uniform.

260
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.180
Well, I was told I couldn't do

261
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.360
it, but I changed my clothes

262
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:43.460
on the helicopter.

263
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.580
You did that?

264
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.740
Well...

265
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.100
I'm sure the boss will be surprised.

266
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.680
I'm going on a patrol.

267
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.440
Yo-chan, be sure to tell Mr.

268
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:54.840
Nakagawa.

269
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.520
See you later.

270
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.060
So, what should I do?

271
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.200
I'll tell you.

272
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.840
You're in charge of education, aren't

273
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:04.940
you?

274
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.640
I'm going on a patrol, too.

275
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.480
Hey!

276
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.900
Oh, man.

277
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.880
Um, I...

278
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.180
Huh?

279
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.600
Stand up and show me the way.

280
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.760
Yes, sir.

281
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.000
Oh, are you a police officer?

282
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.340
Yes, I am.

283
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.160
Oh, that's great.

284
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.780
I'd like to ask you for directions.

285
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.140
Yes, I'd love to.

286
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.870
Senpai, wake up, Senpai.

287
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:42.690
What is it?

288
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.410
You were sleeping so well.

289
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.070
I was asked for directions, but I don

290
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.790
't know anything about this area.

291
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.370
Huh?

292
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:52.270
Huh?

293
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.570
Show me the map and make me look

294
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:54.810
for it.

295
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:55.950
He's an old man who's been

296
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.310
back in Japan for 50 years, and he

297
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.590
says he doesn't know where this is.

298
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.130
Damn it.

299
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.250
I guess I have no choice.

300
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.030
So, where do you want to go?

301
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.350
To a restaurant.

302
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.350
What kind of restaurant?

303
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.590
I forgot the name of the restaurant, but

304
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.130
I have a clue.

305
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:16.310
Huh?

306
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.350
It's a restaurant like this.

307
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.770
Oh, but it's a terrible picture.

308
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.150
Did you draw it?

309
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.030
When I was a student, it was more

310
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.950
than 50 years ago.

311
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:28.970
Huh?

312
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.650
50 years ago?

313
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.730
So, what's the address of the restaurant?

314
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.550
It's in downtown Tokyo.

315
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.610
That's all?

316
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.630
Yes.

317
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:39.930
No, no.

318
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.570
Downtown is a big city.

319
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.810
There's no way he'd know.

320
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.210
Give it up.

321
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.510
I can't do that.

322
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.890
After all, it's my first job.

323
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.890
Do whatever you want.

324
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.870
If you let me look for it, I

325
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.470
'd like to thank you.

326
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:56.210
What?

327
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.110
Why didn't you tell me?

328
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.730
Let's hear the details later.

329
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:01.970
Hey, Nakagawa.

330
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.630
Order coffee and cake at the cafeter

331
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:03.730
ia.

332
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:04.850
Huh?

333
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.790
Hurry up and go.

334
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.110
Yes, sir.

335
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.690
I see.

336
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.050
When I was a student, I went

337
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.090
to that restaurant several times.

338
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.990
What's that?

339
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.030
It's Tokyo Art University now.

340
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.330
It was a lunch break, so it was

341
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.030
always crowded.

342
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:24.390
Huh?

343
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.250
Does that mean it's close to the

344
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:26.350
art university?

345
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.670
Yes.

346
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.210
I think it was about 15 minutes walk.

347
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.710
If it's the art university, it's

348
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.410
in the upper area.

349
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:34.490
Hmm.

350
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:36.910
Huh?

351
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.290
If you don't mind, have this.

352
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.730
Sorry.

353
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.030
All right.

354
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.030
Let's look for it around midnight.

355
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.750
Um...

356
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.970
Huh?

357
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.430
Can we find it in about two hours?

358
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.330
If it's in the upper area, it

359
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.050
'll take 20 to 30 minutes by car,

360
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:51.790
so it'll be fine.

361
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.690
Actually, it's the first time I've

362
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.470
ever been on a plane, so I have

363
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.070
to go back to Paris.

364
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:57.970
Hmm.

365
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.130
If it's in the upper area, it

366
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.170
'll take about an hour by express train,

367
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.310
so it'll be fine.

368
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.750
Nakagawa, get a taxi.

369
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.810
Then I'll call you in my car

370
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:07.750
right away.

371
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.470
Oh, it's me.

372
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.350
Bring the car to the dispatch office right

373
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.450
away.

374
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.430
Yes.

375
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.630
Um...

376
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.390
If you don't mind, I'd like

377
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.550
to have a drink, too.

378
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.390
Oh, thank you.

379
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.250
Oh, here it is.

380
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.110
Oh!

381
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.210
Ferrari F40, isn't it?

382
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.470
Here you go.

383
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.110
But this is for two people, isn't

384
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.210
it?

385
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.730
It's modified for four people, so it

386
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.030
's okay.

387
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.450
Now, get in.

388
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.070
Huh?

389
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.910
Reiko, you're in the right place.

390
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.450
Ryo-chan!

391
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.110
It's a lifesaver.

392
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.230
I'm counting on you.

393
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.050
Huh?

394
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.970
See you!

395
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.450
Oh!

396
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.710
I think I saw him somewhere.

397
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.150
Damn it!

398
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.370
When I don't have time...

399
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.170
Hey, Nakagawa, turn there.

400
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:06.850
I can't, senpai.

401
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.050
It's the exit to the one-

402
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:08.290
way street.

403
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.510
You idiot!

404
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.410
Don't you want to grant the wis

405
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.210
h of a good old man?

406
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.830
Oh, come on.

407
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.250
I'll go backwards.

408
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.790
That's no problem.

409
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:17.930
No way.

410
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.170
I got it.

411
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.870
Senpai, let's go in one go.

412
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.150
Why are you going that far?

413
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:35.930
You idiot!

414
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.010
I don't know.

415
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.170
I don't know.

416
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.520
Ryo-chan's base!

417
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.680
I did it in one go!

418
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.620
It's nice to ride in such a

419
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.940
super bubbly car.

420
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.640
This isn't the time to be impressed.

421
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.740
This time, it's Taro.

422
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.390
Senpai, what should we do?

423
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.610
When you're busy...

424
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.390
Come on!

425
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.690
Show him how amazing Ferrari is!

426
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.650
Yes, sir!

427
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:19.080
He's too fast.

428
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.760
Ryo-chan's base again.

429
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.860
I'm going to beat him this time!

430
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.060
Turn right at that corner.

431
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.200
Turn left after that.

432
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.780
Yes, sir!

433
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.940
I've been playing around here since I

434
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.040
was a kid.

435
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.100
I've been playing around here since I

436
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.200
was a kid.

437
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:40.940
It's like a garden.

438
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.900
Even if it's a shortcut, we can

439
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.500
't go any further.

440
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.640
You idiot!

441
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.360
It's your first job, isn't it?

442
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.580
It's your first job, isn't it?

443
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.740
Once you've been assigned a mission, you

444
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:52.840
'll be able to do it no matter

445
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.480
what happens.

446
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:56.620
You'll be able to do it no

447
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:56.720
matter what happens.

448
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.420
Senpai...

449
00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.060
I was wrong.

450
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.580
All right!

451
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.440
Hey, the road's getting narrower.

452
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.319
Don't worry!

453
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.000
I can get through!

454
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.720
I've been here a few times.

455
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.160
I'm not a cyclist.

456
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.280
Here we go!

457
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.980
I knew you could do it, Senpai!

458
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.280
Oh...

459
00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:25.990
Huh?

460
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.530
This is...

461
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.070
C-Could you stop for a moment?

462
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.850
How nostalgic...

463
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.990
I've lived in Paris for decades, but

464
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.790
recently I've been thinking a lot about

465
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.490
Japan.

466
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.530
That was when I was a student at

467
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.310
Yumeoki Art School.

468
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.210
When I was a student...

469
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.290
I was surrounded by good friends and drew

470
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.910
pictures all day long.

471
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.010
Ueno is a forest of art.

472
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.550
I walked to the museum every day and

473
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.190
exchanged artistic thoughts with my friends.

474
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:00.710
At that time, I fell in love at

475
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.810
first sight with the girl at the cafe

476
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.690
teria that my friend took me to.

477
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.950
It was my first love.

478
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.690
That's the cafeteria in that

479
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.710
picture, right?

480
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.350
When was it?

481
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.850
I think it was close to my graduation,

482
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.650
but it was when I caught a cold

483
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.710
and went to bed.

484
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.470
She came to my house and took care

485
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.650
of me.

486
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.360
When I recovered from my cold, I thought

487
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.800
of thanking her, but at that time I

488
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.500
was poor and didn't have the money

489
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.000
to give her the present I asked for

490
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.100
yesterday.

491
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.860
So I drew her portrait with all my

492
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:45.960
heart.

493
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.680
And I gave her the picture.

494
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.980
The happy face of that girl at that

495
00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.020
time is still etched in my eyes.

496
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.480
So what happened to that girl?

497
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.560
At the same time as I graduated, I

498
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560
went to study in Paris.

499
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.200
I didn't even say I liked it.

500
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.780
It was a long time ago.

501
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.660
Old man!

502
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.160
It's not the time to be immersed

503
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.440
in observation!

504
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.040
We only have an hour left!

505
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.480
Let's look for the cafeteria.

506
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.040
Yeah.

507
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.260
What do you think, old man?

508
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.140
Don't you remember the scenery around here?

509
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.060
This area has changed a lot from 50

510
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.560
years ago.

511
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.080
One hour left.

512
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:49.580
I can't find it.

513
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.660
After all, I decided to take my memories

514
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.100
back to Paris as a memory.

515
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.740
We still have 10 minutes!

516
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.160
I won't give up!

517
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.220
I can't stand giving up!

518
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.140
I can't find a single or two

519
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.240
shops!

520
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.000
The police are waiting for me!

521
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.920
Damn it!

522
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.160
Damn it!

523
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.500
I've been thinking about my first love

524
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:15.740
for 50 years.

525
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.820
I wanted to meet her.

526
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.460
It's okay.

527
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.260
This is also fate.

528
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.740
That tree!

529
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.600
I found it!

530
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.480
I found it!

531
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.260
Look at this shop.

532
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.780
It's just like the picture.

533
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.180
It hasn't changed at all.

534
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.300
Now, let's go meet my first love.

535
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.960
Wait a minute.

536
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.120
What's wrong, old man?

537
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.500
She's probably married and has a family.

538
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.240
I don't want to visit her all

539
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:51.340
of a sudden.

540
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.900
What are you talking about?

541
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.140
Come on, let's go.

542
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.410
But...

543
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.260
If you can't open it, I'll

544
00:20:59.260 --> 00:20:59.520
open it.

545
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.200
Come on.

546
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.580
Open it.

547
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.560
Hurry up and open it!

548
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.460
Misaki...

549
00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.060
Taki...

550
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.980
You're Taki, aren't you?

551
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:21.960
Yes.

552
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.720
It's been a long time.

553
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.860
Yes, it's been a long time.

554
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.980
Taki...

555
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.920
The picture is still in the shop.

556
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.160
What?

557
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.270
You took good care of it.

558
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.130
This picture is my treasure.

559
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.770
Thank you, Misaki.

560
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.550
Senior, look at him.

561
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.550
He looks so happy.

562
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.010
Yes.

563
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.030
We police officers work hard for the smiles

564
00:21:59.030 --> 00:21:59.130
of the citizens.

565
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.470
Police officers are a great job, aren't

566
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.570
they?

567
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.570
By the way, old man, how much will

568
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:06.950
you give me?

569
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.110
Senior...

570
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.150
Thanks to you, I made a good memory.

571
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.710
Please take this as a thank you.

572
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:18.950
Thank you.

573
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.510
Well, I'm leaving now.

574
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.350
Thank you for your help.

575
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.290
Take care.

576
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.670
Goodbye.

577
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:29.990
Let's go home.

578
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.750
Are you going again?

579
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.490
I'm not happy or anything.

580
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.990
I got a terrible picture like this.

581
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.130
Hey, young man.

582
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.870
I'll take this picture.

583
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.570
Are you sure?

584
00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.490
I'm sure.

585
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.630
Let's go.

586
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.030
Taki, Jotaro...

587
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.250
Is the Ferrari broken?

588
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.270
Not at all.

589
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.010
We still have a lot of cars.

590
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.050
Do you have a lot of money?

591
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:08.770
Yes.

592
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.470
I have about 400 trillion yen.

593
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.270
400 trillion yen?

594
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.790
Let's get along well.

595
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.010
Ryo-chan.

596
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:18.990
It's a big deal.

597
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.170
You saw the old man on the Ferrari,

598
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:21.590
didn't you?

599
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.550
Yes, that old man?

600
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.690
No kidding.

601
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.870
He was a world-famous painter.

602
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.410
That's the old man.

603
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:32.990
Is he such a famous painter?

604
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.570
One picture costs at least 100 million yen.

605
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.650
100 million yen?

606
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.070
Hey, Ryo-chan.

607
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.450
I'll ask you later.

608
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.230
My 100 million yen.

609
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.340
I thought of something amazing.

610
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.340
I'll sell ramen on the earth.

611
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.400
It's a flying convenience store.

612
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.980
No one can think of such a great

613
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.300
idea.

614
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.520
Ryoichi Kankichi is a

615
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.200
great genius.

616
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.300
Next on Daihanjo!

617
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:52.330
The Flying Convenience Store Please

618
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:52.770
laugh.

619
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.790
You're not bad.

620
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.470
Please laugh.

621
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.550
Keep it up.

622
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.110
Smile all the time.

623
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.550
A woman who pees is not beautiful.

624
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.430
You're not a child.

625
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.730
You should smile right away.

626
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.030
You're not a child.
