00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:16.650
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Ah, summer

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.330
has come again this year.

3
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.170
Ah, summer has come again this year.

4
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.770
I want to drink in Okinawa.

5
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.970
I want to drink in Okinawa.

6
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.910
Ah, summer has come again this year.

7
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.950
Ah, summer has come again this year.

8
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.230
Thank you for your time.

9
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.770
Please come again.

10
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.590
On a precious day like this, I have

11
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.530
to spend 20,000 yen in 5 hours.

12
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.770
What does it mean to have one cup

13
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.970
noodle?

14
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.530
I have to pay for it.

15
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.530
Damn it.

16
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.050
Noah!

17
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.330
This guy is really good at acting.

18
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:01.890
You dropped something.

19
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.390
Thank you for your hard work.

20
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.350
Thank you for your hard work.

21
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.490
What is it?

22
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.430
You don't need it, do you?

23
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.990
I'll deliver the lost item to the

24
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.190
police.

25
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.030
This is a piece of common sense.

26
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.870
If you come to the police station later,

27
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.950
I'll give you a piece of noodles

28
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.410
as a reward.

29
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.090
I don't need it.

30
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.990
That was close.

31
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.730
It's a survival before the payday.

32
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.670
Even one cup noodle is a valuable food.

33
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.910
That's a miss, too.

34
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.550
That was close.

35
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.650
Hey, what are you doing?

36
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.250
I'm looking for a lottery winne

37
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.350
r.

38
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.690
The four of us bought 40 tickets.

39
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.390
You're doing something stupid while you're

40
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.490
on duty.

41
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.330
Why don't you talk to the world

42
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.310
leaders sometimes?

43
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.690
Like the Japanese soldiers of Borokus and

44
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.310
Hesonogoma.

45
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.870
Borokus and Hesonogoma?

46
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.890
Chief, don't you know?

47
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.890
It's a division of labor.

48
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.410
If you say that, you'll lose to

49
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.510
the boss.

50
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.490
What?

51
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.630
There's no reason for you, who always

52
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.790
looks down on gambling, to be criticized.

53
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.730
The lottery is not gambling.

54
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.710
What is gambling?

55
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.390
It's your own power.

56
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.190
You have to win with your own power.

57
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.070
That's gambling.

58
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.870
That's a strange persuasion.

59
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.450
You're too naive to bet money on

60
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.550
such a thing.

61
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.850
If you want to make money, you need

62
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.790
time and money.

63
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.530
Let's leave him alone and look into

64
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.630
it.

65
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.450
That's right.

66
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.490
There are four tickets left.

67
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.690
Oh, this is...

68
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.270
You're wrong.

69
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.910
Your idea is wrong.

70
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.870
Work according to your expectations.

71
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.570
Ignore, ignore.

72
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.410
It's all out.

73
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.210
Of course.

74
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.770
There's no one like you.

75
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.130
The goddess of good luck smiles.

76
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.190
That's right.

77
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.110
The same lottery ticket from last year may

78
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.290
have been left.

79
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.690
Why don't you look into it?

80
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.830
There should be a lottery number for each

81
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.930
year in this book.

82
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.210
That's right.

83
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.510
Oh, there was one.

84
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.350
In the first place, I don't like

85
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.110
lottery tickets because the winner hides it.

86
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.270
Oh, no one, no two, no three.

87
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.950
What do you think?

88
00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:16.950
Three...

89
00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.269
Three million yen.

90
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.790
You're right.

91
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.270
Come to think of it, in Japan, we

92
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.610
don't announce the winner in front of

93
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.450
the media That's the bad thing about

94
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.550
Japanese people.

95
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.110
Right, chief?

96
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.390
It's not good to be silent when

97
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.490
you're right.

98
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.870
That's...

99
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.810
That's right.

100
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.930
If you go there, it's good to

101
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.590
be a pachinko player or

102
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.210
a horse rider.

103
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.570
It's good to be a pach

104
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.670
inko player.

105
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.070
Whether you win or lose, your emotions will

106
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.590
show up honestly.

107
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.890
Pyo-chan, you lost to a

108
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.230
pachinko today, didn't you?

109
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.710
Shut up!

110
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.250
It's all about luck.

111
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.730
Chief!

112
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.970
How was the lottery?

113
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.010
Oh, that...

114
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.530
I lost.

115
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.690
That's enough about the lottery.

116
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.750
Let's talk about Bosnia and Herz

117
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.070
egovina.

118
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.290
Chief, are you hiding something?

119
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.330
No, I'm not.

120
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.010
You're not?

121
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.190
What is it?

122
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.450
Oh, I see.

123
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.630
The winner's behavior pattern is...

124
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.410
First, as soon as he gets it, he

125
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.190
suddenly becomes silent, and becomes kind.

126
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.230
Second, he changes the subject and stops talking

127
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.970
about the lottery.

128
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.930
Chief, please show me the lottery.

129
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.990
You lost!

130
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.910
You lost!

131
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.170
If I lost, can I see it?

132
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.630
No, you can't!

133
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.330
You can't!

134
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.430
Hey!

135
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.890
That's rude!

136
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.910
You're making me even more suspicious!

137
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.770
I'm not making you suspicious!

138
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.830
I said I lost, so I lost!

139
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.710
He said it, so there's no doubt

140
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.810
about it!

141
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.710
I think you're still suspicious.

142
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.030
Huh?

143
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.230
Oh, no.

144
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.530
Then, please tear the lottery.

145
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.350
What?

146
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.110
You lost, didn't you?

147
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.370
Do you want me to tear it for

148
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.470
you?

149
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.770
No, I'm collecting lottery tickets.

150
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.390
When did you start doing that?

151
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.950
Your eyes are full of lies!

152
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.230
Show me!

153
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.550
What are you doing?

154
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.050
Hey!

155
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.050
Hey, hey!

156
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.110
I'm going to tear it!

157
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.590
Let go of me!

158
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.750
I'm going to tear it!

159
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.210
Ryo-chan, are you okay?

160
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.050
Senpai!

161
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.510
What you just did wasn't worth 100,

162
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.450
000 or 200,000 yen.

163
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.430
It was worth a lot of money!

164
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.770
I read it again!

165
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.430
Give me that book!

166
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.870
Yes, sir.

167
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.350
Which one did you buy?

168
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.410
Well, it's the same as this year

169
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.710
's, so...

170
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.330
Oh, this one!

171
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.330
All right!

172
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.270
I'll read the prize money from the

173
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.370
bottom.

174
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.910
Okay.

175
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.410
5,500,000 yen.

176
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.650
No.

177
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.810
4,000,000 yen.

178
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.530
Huh?

179
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.110
That's not it either.

180
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.990
Next!

181
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.650
3,300,000 yen.

182
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.710
I got it!

183
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.470
It's the 3,000,000 yen prize

184
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.590
money!

185
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.790
N-No!

186
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.590
I'm going to show my face It

187
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.590
's definitely 3,000,000 yen!

188
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.050
No!

189
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.270
It can't be!

190
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.130
It's hard to check the prize money

191
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.010
at the bank these days.

192
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.870
The prize money is due today, so I

193
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.670
have to go get it today or I

194
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.930
'll be in trouble.

195
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.690
Boss, let's go get a drink today.

196
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.970
Until midnight.

197
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.670
I'm sorry.

198
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.970
I actually won 3,000,000 yen.

199
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.950
You did it, boss!

200
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.150
But, I didn't do anything wrong, so

201
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.870
there's nothing to hide.

202
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.670
That's true, but...

203
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.470
You have a bad habit of not showing

204
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.930
your face Seriously.

205
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.690
You should show your joy in your body

206
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:06.950
like a foreigner.

207
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.410
Like this.

208
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.510
I won the lottery!

209
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.850
I'm so happy!

210
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.310
I'm going to win!

211
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.770
I'm going to win the lottery!

212
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.110
I'm going to win the lottery!

213
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.350
Like this.

214
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.190
I want you to express your joy like

215
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:24.290
this.

216
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.650
Do you understand?

217
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.230
I don't know any foreigners like that.

218
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.470
Let's call the police and tell everyone.

219
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.010
How much is it?

220
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.169
Maybe you found out because you happened to

221
00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:36.269
look it up.

222
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.289
It's the same as golf.

223
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.049
It's common sense to have a party

224
00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.090
and celebrate with everyone.

225
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.950
But...

226
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.990
Or...

227
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.770
Did you plan to keep the 3 million

228
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.310
yen to yourself?

229
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.470
No, I didn't.

230
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.350
Then, leave it to me.

231
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.470
This is Ryotsu from the

232
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.030
Hachisho in front of the

233
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.130
park.

234
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.050
I'm holding a party for 200 people

235
00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.690
tonight.

236
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.230
Please prepare a special shabu-

237
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.610
shabu.

238
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.150
Shabu-shabu?

239
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.290
Hey!

240
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.610
I'll go to the library and let

241
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.030
you know.

242
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.690
Ryotsu!

243
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.470
I was lucky to win the lottery.

244
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:16.930
It was unfortunate that Ryotsu

245
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.070
was there.

246
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:30.700
Boss, are you off today?

247
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.940
I've been off since the day after

248
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.040
that.

249
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.820
It's about time to start over.

250
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.560
You must have been in a lot of

251
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:37.840
shock.

252
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.820
You're overdoing it, too.

253
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.640
Ryotsu, you don't have

254
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.960
to do the shabu-sh

255
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.120
abu.

256
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.800
You have to set it up until 8

257
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.020
o'clock.

258
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.920
The boss is on his way to work.

259
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.520
Good morning.

260
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.380
I'm sorry to bother you.

261
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.400
How much did you spend on the party?

262
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.940
I didn't have any money left.

263
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.700
I'm sorry, but don't talk about

264
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.780
it anymore.

265
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.240
I'm getting hot again.

266
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.600
By the way, boss.

267
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.620
I've been into lottery since then.

268
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.420
What?

269
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.020
It's an American lottery.

270
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.700
What's that?

271
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.860
You choose six numbers from 1 to 5

272
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.300
10.

273
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.860
If they match, you win.

274
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.920
The prize money is 5.

275
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:25.660
5 billion yen.

276
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.260
5.

277
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.200
5 billion yen!

278
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.820
I know Ryotsu is into

279
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:34.920
it.

280
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.020
I know that.

281
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.500
But is it that easy?

282
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.000
That's why Ryotsu is

283
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.060
collecting data for the past five years.

284
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.760
He's going to the math teacher to

285
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.420
study the combination of numbers.

286
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.840
He's a hard-working guy.

287
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.260
Hey!

288
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.420
Did you finally come out?

289
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.360
You!

290
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.740
You made a fool of the lottery.

291
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560
You're going to buy it.

292
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.780
Don't say that.

293
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.160
Don't say that.

294
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.080
It's 5.

295
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.060
5 billion yen.

296
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.660
Ryo, I got a notice from overseas.

297
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.960
All right.

298
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.300
I'll keep giving it to you until

299
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:11.400
I get it.

300
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600
Boss, would you like to take a bite

301
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:13.700
of the 5.

302
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.600
5 billion yen dream?

303
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.840
No, I'm fine.

304
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.880
Well, you guys just have to have a

305
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.420
little dream in Japan.

306
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.840
Is it right?

307
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.620
What was the winning number last time?

308
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.020
It's over.

309
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.240
2, 16, 17.

310
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.580
Oh!

311
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.940
So far, it's right.

312
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.340
The next one is 23.

313
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.000
2, 34.

314
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:38.680
Oh!

315
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:39.480
It's right!

316
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.900
No.

317
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.720
I'm going to make you happy so

318
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:43.820
far.

319
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.380
I'm going to disappoint you later.

320
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.420
I knew it.

321
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.740
I chose the 4.

322
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.200
5 curve.

323
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.940
Why didn't you make it 45?

324
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:52.900
4.

325
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.060
5!

326
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.780
I don't have any money!

327
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.120
4.

328
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.360
5?

329
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.420
Could it be...

330
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.740
45?

331
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.360
It's right.

332
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:12.400
It's 5.

333
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.900
5 billion yen.

334
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.400
It's right.

335
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.980
It's right.

336
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.520
Still, the lottery is amazing.

337
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.520
The winning amount is 5.

338
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.400
5 billion yen.

339
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120
Right, Ryotsu?

340
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:35.680
No!

341
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.100
What?

342
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.620
What's wrong?

343
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.940
You don't look well.

344
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.580
Did I sleep well?

345
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.160
I have a little fever.

346
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.500
More importantly, how was the lottery?

347
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.340
What do you mean?

348
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.220
You were looking up the winning number of

349
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.140
the lottery, weren't you?

350
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.160
You scared me!

351
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.800
Anyway, why don't we talk about the

352
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.440
cost of the lottery?

353
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:02.740
Huh?

354
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:03.280
Huh?

355
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.860
Well...

356
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.520
The winning number of the lottery is...

357
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.000
We'll change the topic and not talk

358
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.440
about the lottery.

359
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.640
What?

360
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.760
What happened to the lottery, Ryotsu?

361
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.340
That's...

362
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.340
That's not important.

363
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.520
That's not important?

364
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.560
I'm on duty, so please don't

365
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.300
talk to me for a while.

366
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.180
In addition, you suddenly become silent.

367
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.160
Huh?

368
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.740
I don't want to.

369
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.480
I don't talk much.

370
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.590
You got it.

371
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.330
What do you mean?

372
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:45.750
Don't be stupid.

373
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.690
You got it, didn't you?

374
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:48.490
What do you mean?

375
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.050
You got the winning number of the lottery,

376
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.570
didn't you?

377
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.130
You got the winning number of the lottery,

378
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.330
didn't you?

379
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.370
I don't believe it.

380
00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.510
You got it.

381
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.830
The winning number of the lottery is exactly

382
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.390
the same as the number you chose.

383
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.330
Hey, Nakagawa!

384
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.630
You took a note of it, didn't

385
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:06.730
you?

386
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:07.250
You're dirty!

387
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.630
Because we're thinking about the past together!

388
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.090
Stop it, Ryo-chan!

389
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.050
You got it, didn't you?

390
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.370
5.

391
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.310
5 billion yen.

392
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.230
It's really...

393
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.450
Huh?

394
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.530
You got it, didn't you?

395
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.350
Yes.

396
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:26.690
What?

397
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.210
You told me to make a lot of

398
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:28.650
noise like a foreigner.

399
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.990
You're the representative of the common people.

400
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.510
Don't get me wrong.

401
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.910
I'm going to make a lot of

402
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.230
noise like a foreigner.

403
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:40.790
Here I go.

404
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.430
Oh, happy day!

405
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.950
I got 5.

406
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.330
5 billion yen!

407
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.850
Give me chocolate!

408
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:51.550
It's not a good day to get

409
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.650
5.

410
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.410
5 billion yen.

411
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.010
No.

412
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.910
Look.

413
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.790
His legs are completely twisted.

414
00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.150
Oh, happy!

415
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.210
I got 5.

416
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:00.690
5 billion yen!

417
00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.810
Give me chocolate!

418
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.470
It's rare to see someone so upset.

419
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.470
You should be happy.

420
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.710
I'll let the media know.

421
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.730
What?

422
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.290
I'll let the media know.

423
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.830
You said you'd let everyone know at

424
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.910
times like this, didn't you, Ryo

425
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.190
zo?

426
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.470
That's right.

427
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.010
I want everyone in Japan to know.

428
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.070
Hello.

429
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.690
This is Hachitsudo in front

430
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.550
of Kameari Park.

431
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.250
This is going to be a big deal

432
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.350
starting tomorrow.

433
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:41.910
Yes.

434
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.420
Sorry.

435
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:50.360
Sorry.

436
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:50.980
Ryozo!

437
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.520
You're popular overnight, Senpai.

438
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.400
Damn!

439
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.460
They're all so greedy.

440
00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.000
Look at all these letters.

441
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.820
What?

442
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.860
From Mr. M.

443
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.180
K.

444
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:04.500
who lives in Chiba.

445
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.500
You've got 5.

446
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.780
5 billion yen to yourself, you bastard.

447
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.920
You don't know how to use the

448
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.020
money anyway.

449
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.900
You should go to hell.

450
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.440
Go away!

451
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.960
But...

452
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.320
Don't mess with me!

453
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.740
Komachi and Naoko Ryo-

454
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.040
sama, will you marry me?

455
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.920
I've always admired you, Ryo-

456
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.180
sama.

457
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.880
Ryo-sama?

458
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.360
Ryo-sama, I thought you'd

459
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.500
do something big someday.

460
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.040
I want to be in love with R

461
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.780
yo-sama soon.

462
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.440
Hey, Komachi.

463
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.020
It's okay, Naoko.

464
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:47.880
I'm the one who's going to

465
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.220
marry Ryo-sama!

466
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.320
Ryo-chan, until yesterday, you were

467
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.660
the number one man I didn't want

468
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:54.760
to marry.

469
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.600
Shut up!

470
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.060
If I'm going to marry you, it

471
00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.220
's better to throw away 5.

472
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:58.820
5 billion yen.

473
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.300
What did you say?

474
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.480
You're rude!

475
00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.119
Beat!

476
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.460
Hey, Ryo-tsu, do something!

477
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.060
If you don't come out, this panic

478
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.599
won't end!

479
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.599
Both of you!

480
00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.099
Both of you!

481
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.020
Hey!

482
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.619
Get out of here!

483
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.020
I still haven't got 5.

484
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.460
5 billion yen, so no comment!

485
00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.040
But...

486
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.560
Don't make excuses!

487
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.380
Shut up!

488
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.440
When I get the cash, I'll answer

489
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.360
anything, and I'll tell you how to

490
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:33.460
use it!

491
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.380
So, everyone, get out of here!

492
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.420
See you!

493
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.580
Bye-bye!

494
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.340
Goodbye!

495
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.180
What?

496
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.020
Okay!

497
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.280
Got it!

498
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.100
What's the matter?

499
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.680
I heard there was a transfer from America.

500
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.580
A transfer of 5.

501
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.420
5 billion yen?

502
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.180
Shut up!

503
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.900
You're too loud!

504
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.800
The media will hear you!

505
00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:00.920
You're not going to tell the media?

506
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.660
Of course not!

507
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.500
Anyway, I'm going to get it.

508
00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.600
I'll leave the rest to you.

509
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.280
We're here.

510
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.820
Please come in, Master.

511
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.160
Good work.

512
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.580
Hello, everyone.

513
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.300
How are you doing?

514
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.000
Ryo-tsu, what's that

515
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.380
outfit?

516
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:37.720
It's a branded item I ordered for

517
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.060
3 million yen.

518
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.780
Master, it's not a branded item, it

519
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.620
's a brand item.

520
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.660
What did you say?

521
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.060
I'm sorry.

522
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.000
Let me introduce you.

523
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:52.940
This is Sato, who will be working

524
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.640
as my butler from today.

525
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.760
I'm Sato.

526
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.520
I look forward to working with you.

527
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.040
Hello, I'm Nagagawa.

528
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:02.780
I'm Reiko.

529
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.700
I'm Ohara, the manager.

530
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.980
Come to think of it, Nagagawa

531
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.860
and Reiko have always helped me.

532
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.700
I don't have much, but I'll

533
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:10.980
take it.

534
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.120
This much?

535
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.080
Can I really take it?

536
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:15.740
Of course.

537
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.900
Ryo-tsu!

538
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:18.620
Don't spend so much!

539
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.360
Save up!

540
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.020
Save up!

541
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.180
Here you go.

542
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.420
This is for the manager.

543
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.000
What is it?

544
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.380
I spent 3 million yen at the party

545
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.260
the other day.

546
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.940
Please take it as an apology.

547
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.900
This much?

548
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.240
Here you go.

549
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.440
Oh, that's right.

550
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.180
Let's do that.

551
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.460
Let's go to the room in the

552
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.560
back with 3 million yen.

553
00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.500
Understood.

554
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.310
What is this?

555
00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:01.830
I've always wanted to try it when

556
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.930
I became rich!

557
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.110
I can't stand this view!

558
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.650
I can't stand this view!

559
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.170
Manager, here you go.

560
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.530
You idiot!

561
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:09.950
You can't do that!

562
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:11.850
He's rich, isn't he?

563
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.170
It's not too late to save up.

564
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.310
It's not too late?

565
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.510
Ryo-tsu, have you decided

566
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.050
on how to use it?

567
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.510
Yes.

568
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.370
I'll order it on the day I

569
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.610
get it, and it should arrive today.

570
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.470
It seems to have arrived.

571
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.930
What did he order?

572
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.660
He ordered a real combat helicopter!

573
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.620
And it's made of gold!

574
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.660
That's ridiculous!

575
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.320
A real one would cost more than 100

576
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:42.820
million yen!

577
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.160
Ha ha ha!

578
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.040
Are you surprised?

579
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.220
Of course, you can't buy a real

580
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.320
one.

581
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.760
This is a 1 in 1 scale Rad

582
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.340
icon helicopter.

583
00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.880
It looks just like the real one.

584
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.020
And it's a gold-plated

585
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.400
model.

586
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.860
It costs at least 50 million yen!

587
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.780
Ha ha ha!

588
00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.440
That's crazy.

589
00:20:59.160 --> 00:20:59.720
Manager!

590
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.600
Manager!

591
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.500
Have you loaded it?

592
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:02.780
Yes, I have.

593
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.600
All right!

594
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.020
Let's fly for the first time!

595
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.320
Welcome aboard.

596
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:23.250
It's really flying.

597
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.090
Senpai, what are you planning to do?

598
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:26.770
I can't stand it!

599
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:27.910
It looks like it's flying on a

600
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:28.150
real helicopter!

601
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.610
If it's going to cost 5.

602
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.730
5 billion yen, it's better for me

603
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.830
to save up than to donate.

604
00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:36.950
All right!

605
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.550
Let's scatter it in the park.

606
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.110
Ha ha ha!

607
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:44.990
Huh?

608
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.470
Huh?

609
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.130
Ha ha ha ha ha!

610
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.390
Dear citizens of Chodai!

611
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.430
I, Yotsu Kankichi, have

612
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.630
donated 5.

613
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.650
5 billion yen!

614
00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.290
It's a pleasure for me to be

615
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.250
the only one to enjoy this honor, so

616
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.110
I'll share it with you!

617
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.090
Whoa!

618
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:06.670
Here you go!

619
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.770
These are the treasured goods.

620
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.510
What a big pile.

621
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:12.890
They spread these out all over the place.

622
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.870
Those are the remaining 5-billion

623
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:15.650
yen worth of money, sir.

624
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:16.250
5...

625
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.510
5-billion yen?

626
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.390
Ha ha ha!

627
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.190
This is amazing!

628
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.710
Ha ha ha ha!

629
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.110
Ha ha ha ha!

630
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.130
And there's some of this, too!

631
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.010
It's so much fun!

632
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.470
So much fun!

633
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.110
And I've got this, too!

634
00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.870
This, too.

635
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:38.970
And take this with you!

636
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.870
Oh, no...

637
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.970
The prop...

638
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.060
Without the prop, the pilot...

639
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.820
My helicopter...

640
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.080
My 5 billion yen helicopter!

641
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.980
What about my deposit?

642
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.200
Ryo, we're in big trouble!

643
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.320
The U.

644
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.540
S.

645
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.280
Federal Reserve is going to take 30%

646
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.620
of the lottery!

647
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.080
Huh?

648
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:24.620
They want us to pay 35% of

649
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.060
the 5 billion yen as taxes!

650
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.160
Huh?

651
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.240
35% of the 5 billion yen?

652
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.540
Huh?

653
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:34.540
16.

654
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.660
5 billion yen?

655
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.320
Click.

656
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.600
I made 15 billion yen, and I used

657
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.000
it all up in no time.

658
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.160
And now I have to pay 16.

659
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.980
5 billion yen in taxes.

660
00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.400
What a stupid book.

661
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.510
Welcome, welcome!

662
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:07.830
It's snowing in the middle of

663
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:08.030
summer!

664
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.550
On hot days, we have shaved ice!

665
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.890
Ryo's specialty, Alaska straight milk!

666
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.410
We don't need any extra shaved ice!

667
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.510
Next time, Shaved Ice!

668
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.770
Don't miss it!

669
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:35.360
