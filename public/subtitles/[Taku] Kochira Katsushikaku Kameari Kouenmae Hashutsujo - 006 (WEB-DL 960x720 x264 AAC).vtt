's dark riddance of bashfulness

29
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.230
Get out of my way!

30
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.590
I did it!

31
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.390
The speedometer is now in the red

32
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.790
zone of 1 million revolutions!

33
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.590
It's powering up to 2 million

34
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.690
revolutions!

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.750
Hand-to-hand combat!

36
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.750
I'm scared!

37
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.509
I'm scared!

38
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.830
It's dangerous!

39
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.300
Stop at the bend.

40
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.920
Look to the right and left to see

41
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.020
if a car is coming.

42
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.680
Make sure it's safe.

43
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.320
Got it?

44
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.680
Run!

45
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.520
Don't jump out!

46
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.340
I can't go.

47
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.700
Are you okay?

48
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.280
If we're late for our shift, R

49
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.740
yo-chan will be annoyed.

50
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.780
Reiko-chan!

51
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.640
Hello!

52
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.440
How's your uncle's fever?

53
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.640
His fever's gone down.

54
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.400
He'll be able to go to the

55
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.360
store in a few days.

56
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.880
It's hard for you to do it

57
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.100
alone.

58
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.840
Take care of yourself.

59
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.420
Take care!

60
00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.900
Wait!

61
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.100
I'm always grateful to Reiko-

62
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.100
chan for taking care of me.

63
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.460
It's business, but take it.

64
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.100
Um...

65
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.200
I was told it was 12 o'clock,

66
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.340
but I'm completely late.

67
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.600
Here.

68
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.940
Thank you!

69
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.920
You're a good girl, Reiko-

70
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.140
chan.

71
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.540
There aren't many good-nature

72
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.320
d girls these days.

73
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.600
She's a good girl, and she's

74
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.040
special.

75
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.700
I can't replace her with my wife.

76
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.720
You're right.

77
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.600
Let's go, Grandma.

78
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.040
Okay.

79
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.400
If we take a detour, there's

80
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.080
a pedestrian bridge.

81
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.560
There are a lot of cars here, so

82
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.000
it'll be a hassle.

83
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.360
There's a traffic light here, so hold

84
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.880
on a little longer.

85
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.680
Hurry up!

86
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.120
Please wait a moment.

87
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.940
Yes, yes.

88
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.560
What is it?

89
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.340
Um...

90
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.180
That old lady waited a long time to

91
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.280
cross this bridge.

92
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.600
Hold on for about 30 seconds.

93
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.960
Okay.

94
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.120
Thank you for your cooperation.

95
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.100
Thank you very much.

96
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.660
You're welcome.

97
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.440
Be careful.

98
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.380
That's great!

99
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.020
Reiko-san, could you come here

100
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.240
for a moment?

101
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.940
Huh?

102
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.410
I've been here every day for a

103
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.510
while.

104
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.950
I'm in front of the kindergarten.

105
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.890
I'm in front of the kindergarten, and

106
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.170
I've been told many times that it

107
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.770
's dangerous for children to be in the

108
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.570
shadow of a car.

109
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.650
It's right in the middle of the

110
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.350
pedestrian bridge.

111
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.510
It's cool.

112
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.790
The car with my number is parked in

113
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.890
front of the kindergarten.

114
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.830
So...

115
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.590
I'm waiting for you.

116
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.050
You're in a nearby repair factory.

117
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.970
You're coming, aren't you?

118
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.930
These people said the same thing yesterday.

119
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.430
It's all a lie.

120
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.710
Go home!

121
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.390
Here's your driver's license.

122
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.990
Give me a break.

123
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.690
I don't have a score anymore.

124
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.570
You're cute, old lady.

125
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.090
You don't have a driver's license.

126
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.530
You don't even move.

127
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.670
Do you think you can live here?

128
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.910
I don't care.

129
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.930
Get out of here!

130
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.590
Then I'll make you move.

131
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.110
Huh?

132
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.230
Huh?

133
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.060
What's that?

134
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.100
It's supposed to be a pump for

135
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.620
jacking up.

136
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.380
If you raise the level to the maximum,

137
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.080
it will inflate anywhere.

138
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.000
On!

139
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.240
Hey, stop it!

140
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.920
I don't know how to stop it.

141
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.760
It's my first time using it.

142
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.040
What?

143
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.920
Darn it!

144
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.480
What's that?

145
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:17.060
What a sexy leg!

146
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.080
What a scary leg!

147
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.220
I can't let it go on like

148
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.320
this.

149
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.660
Of course.

150
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.380
Pay me back properly.

151
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.480
Oh, no!

152
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.410
Welcome back.

153
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.910
You're late!

154
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.130
You're late!

155
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.410
I'm sorry, Ryo-chan.

156
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.450
The shift starts at noon.

157
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.150
It's already past 1 o'clock.

158
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.650
I'm sick and tired of waiting.

159
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.370
Which is more important, the patrol or my

160
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.750
life?

161
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.970
Even if you say that, you're there

162
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.510
at 4 or 6 o'clock.

163
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.530
Chief Ohara won't come to the

164
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.230
head office today.

165
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.310
He's always like that.

166
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.370
I'll go to the patrol.

167
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.990
Oh, I'm hungry.

168
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.430
I'm hungry.

169
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.550
You never came back, so I couldn't

170
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.950
go out for lunch.

171
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.710
Don't boil the noodles too much.

172
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.230
Add more green onions.

173
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.990
I didn't forget the shift.

174
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.789
It was tough.

175
00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.950
This and that.

176
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:38.909
One after another.

177
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.390
Hey, Reiko.

178
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.530
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

179
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.950
Get me that newspaper.

180
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.310
Take it yourself.

181
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.270
Isn't it faster to take it yourself?

182
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.970
There's a bad guy in the office.

183
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.930
Even if I say it's a parking

184
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.830
violation, he doesn't listen at all.

185
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.670
He thinks it's rude, so he's

186
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.310
licking his head.

187
00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.830
By the way, press on my back.

188
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.710
Lower, lower.

189
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:06.950
Not there.

190
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.010
There, there.

191
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.130
Press hard.

192
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.170
Yes, yes, yes.

193
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.130
Like this?

194
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.250
It's no good.

195
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.710
It doesn't work at all.

196
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.030
That's why he's licking his

197
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.130
head.

198
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.470
It doesn't matter.

199
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.470
What patrols need is the force that

200
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:24.250
comes out of their faces.

201
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.970
Your face doesn't have any force.

202
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.570
It's itchy.

203
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:31.890
Write it down there.

204
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.390
Here?

205
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.930
Yes, yes, yes.

206
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.330
Hey, are the noodles okay?

207
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.970
Don't put too much in.

208
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.070
It's okay.

209
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.050
Oh, it's itchy again.

210
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.290
Ouch!

211
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.550
What are you doing?

212
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:44.710
It's all about force at the end,

213
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.070
right?

214
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.410
Oh, how frustrating!

215
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.850
I'll hit you.

216
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.170
I'll run away.

217
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.510
What's that?

218
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.570
It's a special pillow for Ryo

219
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:57.750
-chan.

220
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.030
It's handmade.

221
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:00.970
What?

222
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:01.070
Ouch!

223
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.500
How's that?

224
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.280
Let's start the counterattack!

225
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.860
Realize the power of a man's

226
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.060
bottom!

227
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.400
You're mean!

228
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.600
You lost.

229
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.000
The real fight starts now.

230
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.360
If you can't use your strength, use

231
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.720
your endurance.

232
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.240
Come on, come on, come on, come on,

233
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.240
come on, come on!

234
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.960
Oh, I got it.

235
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.720
That's enough.

236
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.340
I give up.

237
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.320
Not yet, not yet.

238
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.540
What a persistent woman.

239
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.460
Yes?

240
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.740
I saw the poster.

241
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.100
Huh?

242
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.380
Who are you calling?

243
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.800
You're Reiko, right?

244
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.980
Who are you?

245
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.720
Please go on a date with me.

246
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.820
What?

247
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.200
Who are you?

248
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.780
Who are you?

249
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.940
What's wrong with this number?

250
00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.180
Because it's written on the poster.

251
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.620
What's that?

252
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:11.640
What's wrong?

253
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:12.620
I don't know.

254
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.020
It's a strange phone call about the

255
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.120
poster.

256
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.440
Hello?

257
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.300
Are you Reiko?

258
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.760
Who are you?

259
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.320
Would you like to go to the beach

260
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:22.520
with me?

261
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.780
I won't go.

262
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.580
Then, let's go to the mountains.

263
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.580
Go alone.

264
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.440
What's this?

265
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.180
It comes to my mind.

266
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.940
It's rude to go on a date

267
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.040
without an introduction.

268
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.200
What's the date?

269
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.400
Date?

270
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.700
Let me borrow it.

271
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.900
Reiko?

272
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.700
Yes.

273
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.420
Do you want to go on a date?

274
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.360
Yes.

275
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.260
First, give me 5,000 yen as an

276
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.360
introduction.

277
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.020
If you say something stupid, I'll arrest

278
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.140
you.

279
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.020
Reiko.

280
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.040
There's a lot of this on the

281
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.220
table.

282
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.400
What's this?

283
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.840
What's this?

284
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.480
Did they call me because of this?

285
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.220
It's a bad picture.

286
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.380
Who is this?

287
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.060
I took it off.

288
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.940
But it's still stuck to the wal

289
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.040
l.

290
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.260
It's a bad picture.

291
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.460
Do you know who it is?

292
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.460
Of course I don't know.

293
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.680
This is Naoko.

294
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.700
This is Naoko.

295
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.660
Answer me.

296
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.560
Answer me.

297
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.910
I found a suspicious large dump truck.

298
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.910
I'm currently following it.

299
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:45.810
I'm heading for Kameari.

300
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.930
Please support me.

301
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.810
The driver was wearing a poster of Re

302
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.010
iko.

303
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.150
Roger that.

304
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.990
I'll kill him with scissors.

305
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.270
It's terrible.

306
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.990
It's Reiko's big update.

307
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.910
They're both checking the signal.

308
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.350
That's great.

309
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.630
Reiko.

310
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.370
I was pulled away by the dump truck.

311
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:38.810
Can't you see it?

312
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.710
Is that it?

313
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.230
What?

314
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:52.890
Hurry up, Ryo.

315
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.810
What's going on?

316
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.190
Watch out.

317
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:26.940
Are you okay?

318
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.380
I'm fine.

319
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.700
That's great.

320
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.640
Look.

321
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.580
I was pulled away by the dump truck.

322
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.700
Ouch.

323
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.080
I hurt my back.

324
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.220
I won't forgive you.

325
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.580
Reiko.

326
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.780
You're being reckless.

327
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.780
Put on your seat belt.

328
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.720
I'll report to the horse.

329
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:53.760
This is Ryo.

330
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.740
I'm currently following the dump truck.

331
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.320
The driver was wearing a poster of Re

332
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.420
iko.

333
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.660
Roger that.

334
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.160
I'll kill him with scissors.

335
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:02.700
I'll kill him with scissors.

336
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.600
You guys head straight for Midkaido.

337
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.600
That's why I told you to put

338
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.280
on your seat belt.

339
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.270
Don't move.

340
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.740
It's just like they said.

341
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.160
What happened, Reiko?

342
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.020
Listen, you guys.

343
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.260
The kids were about to be pulled away.

344
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.240
And...

345
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.820
What's your grudge?

346
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.440
I don't have a grudge.

347
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.660
Then why did you stick it all over

348
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:18.760
the town?

349
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:19.880
Reiko.

350
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.320
Look over there.

351
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.880
It's them.

352
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:26.760
Them?

353
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.220
Oh, no.

354
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.780
They found us.

355
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.740
They're coming.

356
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:32.900
I'll take care of the rest.

357
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:33.720
Okay.

358
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:34.900
Hurry up, Ryo.

359
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.520
What's going on?

360
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.730
That's the car that stopped in front

361
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.370
of the kindergarten.

362
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.190
It's a bunch of illegal parking.

363
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.470
But still, what a terrible car.

364
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.530
It's like a natural monument.

365
00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:02.420
What's going on?

366
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.859
Why are you driving so fast?

367
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.160
Shut up!

368
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.500
Come on!

369
00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:09.300
Don't let them get away!

370
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.280
If this is how it's going to

371
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.060
be, I'm going to break it down

372
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:14.160
even more.

373
00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.079
Damn it.

374
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:19.800
You're a pain in the ass.

375
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.839
That's not a good way to do

376
00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:24.939
it.

377
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.020
You're the one who's rough.

378
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.660
You broke my car for a little money.

379
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.340
If you have a good reason, why don

380
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:32.940
't you go back to school?

381
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.080
That's right.

382
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.580
That's right.

383
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.340
That's enough.

384
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.220
Wait for me!

385
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.520
Calm down, Reiko.

386
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.120
I know how you feel, but the Min

387
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.120
ipet is just a 550cc light

388
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.400
car.

389
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:50.940
There's no way they can catch up

390
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.940
to a 2,000cc car.

391
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.740
Hey, they're still following us.

392
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.290
It's not just a light car.

393
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.090
It's not easy to go that far

394
00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:04.190
in a light car.

395
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.110
Let's go into high speed.

396
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.330
That car can't go fast.

397
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.370
This is Reiko.

398
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.130
Yes, this is the Kamayari Park.

399
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.990
Kei, I have a favor to ask

400
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.090
you.

401
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.130
I can't see anything.

402
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:33.830
Hey, Reiko!

403
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.480
I'm going to lose.

404
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.080
Hurry up and stop the car!

405
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.620
I'm going to lose.

406
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.220
Here it is!

407
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.000
Oh, it's an Audi Quattro.

408
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.900
I'm sorry I'm late.

409
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.540
I just got here yesterday.

410
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.660
This is a car that won the Monte

411
00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.260
Carlo Rally.

412
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.140
The collector gave it to me for free.

413
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.440
Then I'll borrow it.

414
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.140
I didn't see it earlier, but something

415
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.640
strange is chasing us instead of the Min

416
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:18.740
ipet.

417
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.140
Hey, maybe they're...

418
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.000
Hey, Niku!

419
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.020
Go, go!

420
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:28.800
We're almost there!

421
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.840
Oh, what's wrong?

422
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.880
It's like a gas pipe.

423
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.880
I'm so frustrated!

424
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.340
What's wrong with you, Nakagawa?

425
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.240
If you hate gas, fill it up.

426
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.840
There's no gas station at high speed.

427
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.680
Gasoline Nikkei!

428
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.000
Reiko, slow down.

429
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.720
Kishiro, let's get it from

430
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.920
the Audi in the back.

431
00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.440
What?

432
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.720
Damn it!

433
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.520
What are they doing?

434
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.140
Damn it!

435
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.120
I can't stand it!

436
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.940
One liter is 100 yen.

437
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.300
45 liters is 4,500 yen.

438
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.000
Reiko, give me 4,500 yen.

439
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.700
I don't need it!

440
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.380
You don't need it?

441
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.740
That means you don't need it.

442
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.320
Okay, I got the fishing line.

443
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.320
What's this?

444
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.680
Give me the money!

445
00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.740
Reiko, hurry up!

446
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.560
Give me the fishing line!

447
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.400
My money!

448
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.300
Give me the fishing line!

449
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.580
My money!

450
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.840
Here it comes again.

451
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.900
I'm sick of it!

452
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.300
Damn it!

453
00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.260
My money!

454
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.240
Damn it!

455
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.580
Reiko, go!

456
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.940
I'll forgive you!

457
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.660
Wait a minute!

458
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.520
The highway!

459
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:14.620
Don't reverse!

460
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.540
You're overdoing it, Reiko!

461
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.170
What?

462
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.440
It's impossible to go through the snow.

463
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.960
I wonder how far I can go in

464
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.060
this car.

465
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.660
Stop it, Reiko!

466
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.180
Even if it's an Audi, you can

467
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.520
't go through the snow with two cars.

468
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.340
Stop it!

469
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.000
No!

470
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.500
I'm sorry!

471
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.580
Help me!

472
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.660
I'm scared!

473
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.700
It's scary to look down on a

474
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.000
woman.

475
00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.320
I can't let this guy turn into

476
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:20.560
an enemy.

477
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.400
It's okay to go up, but I

478
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.080
wonder how far it is.

479
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.100
Good morning.

480
00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.540
Good morning.

481
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.100
I put on too much wax.

482
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.660
Good morning.

483
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.660
What happened to those two?

484
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.000
They fell in love with Reiko's

485
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.860
driving technique and decided to become her app

486
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:54.960
rentice.

487
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.100
It's been a while since I had

488
00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.290
such a terrible feeling.

489
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.520
You guys should be careful of Reiko,

490
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.260
too.

491
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.020
Okay?

492
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.420
Ryo, did you call me?

493
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.620
Here's your tea.

494
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.500
Reiko, thank you for your delicious tea.

495
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.060
Thank you.

496
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.880
The weather is nice.

497
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.060
Be careful.

498
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.080
I know.

499
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.540
Oh, it's the old lady from before.

500
00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.060
You're so kind.

501
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.420
You're welcome.

502
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.700
Reiko.

503
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.420
Oh, old lady.

504
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.220
What's wrong?

505
00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.180
Actually, I have something to tell you.

506
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.500
What?

507
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.260
You're an old lady, too.

508
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.880
You're so kind.

509
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.440
Hey.

510
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.400
If you marry her, you'll get a

511
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.880
lot of money.

512
00:23:52.720 --> 00:24:04.520
This year

513
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.500
is the year of the Olympics.

514
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.120
Speaking of the Olympics, it's the year

515
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.320
of the sun.

516
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.840
The sun is a sign of good luck.

517
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.380
He's a member of the 8th

518
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:11.660
division of the U.

519
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:11.760
S.

520
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:11.860
Marine Corps.

521
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.560
He wakes up once every four years.

522
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.580
But he has an amazing super power.

523
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.000
Next time on the Awaken, Private

524
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.240
Tommy!

525
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.400
Please look forward to it!
