Bousou Daibakutou!

19
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.980
In this area, especially in our jurisdiction, there

20
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.820
are a lot of traffic accidents.

21
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.320
That's why, next week, in this area,

22
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.600
a traffic safety guidance workshop will be held.

23
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.400
On that day, all of you will participate

24
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.840
as a guide.

25
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.800
So, I'll give you some guidance ideas

26
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.240
that are easy for the children to understand.

27
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.940
There are a lot of traffic accidents, so

28
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.200
it's troublesome, isn't it, Ryo

29
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.460
-tsu?

30
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.300
That's right.

31
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.920
Like someone who breaks the speed limit on

32
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.020
a bicycle.

33
00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:08.020
I don't like that.

34
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.340
Like someone who ignores the traffic lights

35
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.440
because it's a bicycle.

36
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.740
I don't like that either.

37
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.600
Like someone who rushes into a shop

38
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.300
keeper's shop on a bicycle and destroys

39
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.700
the storefront.

40
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.660
I don't like that either.

41
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.880
Like someone who makes a plastic model and

42
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.940
doesn't listen to what people say.

43
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.360
I don't like that either.

44
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.480
You're a fool!

45
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.140
I'm talking about you!

46
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.060
I'm listening!

47
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.220
I'm making a plastic model for the

48
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.140
sake of mental unity!

49
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.760
Don't be ridiculous!

50
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.600
Do you think that helix is that

51
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.900
easy?

52
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.020
It's the same as making black tea!

53
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.000
Don't compare a plastic model to black

54
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.180
tea!

55
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.840
What's going to happen to the

56
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.480
traffic safety?

57
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.820
I don't know.

58
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.680
Anyway, think of an idea to prevent traffic

59
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.840
accidents by the end of the class.

60
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.600
Got it?

61
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.180
I'm not kidding.

62
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.180
An idea to prevent accidents?

63
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.940
It's simple.

64
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.600
Everyone has to get in the car, right?

65
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.260
We're busy making models.

66
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.660
Damn it.

67
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.740
Um...

68
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.440
Excuse me.

69
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.080
Yes?

70
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.100
What can I do for you?

71
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.200
Um...

72
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.860
Is Ryo-chan here?

73
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.720
Oh, it's you, Honda!

74
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.380
It's been a while.

75
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.760
Are you Ryo-chan's junior?

76
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.100
Nice to meet you.

77
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.600
I'm Honda from the traffic police.

78
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.520
Actually, I'm going to be in the

79
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.080
same class as you, so...

80
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.520
I'd like to say hello to you

81
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.620
today.

82
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.320
Wow, it looks delicious!

83
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.020
This is a chocolate cake I baked.

84
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.120
Thank you.

85
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.400
Hey, Surara-chan's face is

86
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.180
cute, isn't it?

87
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.060
Surara-chan?

88
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.020
She's the main character of the anime.

89
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.520
The girl in the park, Surara, is

90
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.500
pretty popular right now.

91
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.380
The voice of Surara-chan, voice

92
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.540
actor Katsuragi Maya-chan,

93
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.720
is super cute, too.

94
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.120
Stop it today.

95
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.780
But...

96
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.800
Damn it!

97
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.320
Hey!

98
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.240
It's nice to meet you!

99
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.600
This is a place of rampage!

100
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.360
Stop it!

101
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.980
Stop it!

102
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.860
I can't stop it!

103
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.360
Hey!

104
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.980
Stop it!

105
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.380
I'm scared!

106
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.360
I'm scared!

107
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.780
I'm scared!

108
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.460
I'm scared!

109
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.520
They're going crazy.

110
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.620
Are you chasing Komachi and Naoko?

111
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.500
It's a super mini-car!

112
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.600
It's no good!

113
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.020
The performance of the machine is different!

114
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.700
It's no good.

115
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.680
I can't catch up with them.

116
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.060
I don't care if it's a

117
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.640
remodeled motorcycle.

118
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.800
Honda!

119
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.420
Hey, you came by motorcycle today, didn't

120
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.520
you?

121
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.760
Yes, I always ride a motorcycle.

122
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.560
All right, Honda, you go after them.

123
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.840
I'm scared.

124
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.880
I'm a little...

125
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.960
Just ride a motorcycle!

126
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.700
Why?

127
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.220
If you're here, it's a battle.

128
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.320
It's impossible for Honda-san.

129
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.660
It's no good!

130
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.400
It's no good!

131
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.220
Anyway, ride it!

132
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.280
Stop it, Ryo-chan.

133
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.380
I feel sorry for Honda-san.

134
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.440
It's too fast!

135
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.360
I don't want to!

136
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.500
I knew it.

137
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.120
All

138
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:44.920
right,

139
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.860
let's go!

140
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.060
Who is this guy?

141
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.320
I'm Honda.

142
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.720
I'm the late Honda.

143
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.900
I'm the late Honda.

144
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.400
What a great technique!

145
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.600
Are you ready, Ryo-chan's

146
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.760
boss?

147
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.620
Yes.

148
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.080
Let's go!

149
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.600
What's wrong with him?

150
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.520
He's not the same as before.

151
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.260
It's gone!

152
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.640
What was that?

153
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.580
It looked like a white bird.

154
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.260
It's a cabaret of the

155
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.360
second dimension.

156
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.560
It's an exhaust note that shakes the

157
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.660
soul.

158
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.580
The heart is always very hot!

159
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.900
I'm getting goosebumps!

160
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.620
Hey!

161
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.220
The cockroaches have caught up!

162
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.080
Oh no!

163
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.680
It's a white bird!

164
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.020
Do you think you can run away from

165
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.120
me?

166
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.280
Stop, you bastard!

167
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.910
What?

168
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.900
What is this?

169
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.880
What's going on?

170
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.800
You're late, ladies.

171
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.680
Mr. Honda sent us here.

172
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.100
Wow!

173
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.280
It's so cool!

174
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.180
What is this?

175
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.980
Could it be...

176
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.400
Mr. Honda?

177
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.000
Yes, that's right!

178
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.100
Honda used to be a gang.

179
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.340
Now he's a traffic police officer.

180
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.140
But when he rides a motorcycle, his personality

181
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.620
changes drastically.

182
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.420
On the street, he's known as the

183
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.760
devil of two wheels.

184
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.640
He's feared by everyone.

185
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.980
The devil of two wheels?

186
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.040
The engine has warmed up.

187
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.000
Mr. Honda, do you want to go for

188
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.380
another run?

189
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.340
Yes, let's go!

190
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.360
The devil of two wheels?

191
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.760
No way!

192
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.200
Wasn't the traffic light red?

193
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.520
I don't know.

194
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.420
It's not a violation if you can

195
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:17.520
't find it.

196
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.320
Oh, I found it.

197
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.920
He's trying to run away He's

198
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.300
stubborn.

199
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.040
It's hot, baby!

200
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.040
Don't you have to stop?

201
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.059
I have to stop.

202
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.100
What are you doing?

203
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.340
I'm going to shoot you!

204
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.000
Hey, driver!

205
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.580
What are you doing?

206
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.880
Ignore the traffic light.

207
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.740
What are you doing?

208
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.400
Oh, no!

209
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.780
Hey, move the car!

210
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.700
But the engine...

211
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.000
What?

212
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.460
Is it my fault?

213
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.140
No, it's...

214
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.500
Do you have a problem with that?

215
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.990
You idiot!

216
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.130
You're a violator, but

217
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.770
you broke three motorcycles and one car.

218
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.230
And you caused a big traffic jam.

219
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.990
What kind of person are you?

220
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.670
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.510
You're a big deal.

222
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.590
Well, Mr. Honda, I'm sorry.

223
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.370
You're the one who turned off the

224
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.350
engine, right?

225
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.970
No, I didn't.

226
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.730
He said he wanted to go for another

227
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.830
run.

228
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.290
I didn't say that.

229
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.870
But Mr. Ryotsu told you to

230
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.970
go.

231
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.850
No, I didn't.

232
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.590
I didn't do that.

233
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.570
Well, you're the one who died.

234
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.650
No, I didn't.

235
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.530
No more questions!

236
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.050
Ryotsu, I'll give you 10

237
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.850
0 poisoning kits to keep you

238
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:56.950
safe.

239
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.170
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.410
Poison everything Ouch!

241
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.970
Do I have to read all of this?

242
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.990
It's done!

243
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.290
1750 horsepower, two-stage, three-

244
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.490
speed engine, with a large output engine.

245
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:18.190
A masterpiece produced by Germany, which has crossed

246
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.490
the European skies.

247
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.590
Junkers Jumo 213H.

248
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.930
Also known as Tank 152.

249
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.670
Hey, old man.

250
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.190
Are you studying traffic safety?

251
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.350
If you don't read the book, the

252
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.550
manager will get mad at you again.

253
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.290
I can't read this kind of stuff.

254
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.750
Don't play with dolls like that.

255
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.970
I'm not playing.

256
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.630
The manager asked me to make it.

257
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.010
I'm going to use it for tomorrow

258
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.330
's traffic safety training.

259
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.750
I'm going to hit a car with

260
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.850
a doll that looks like Ryo-

261
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.490
chan and do a traffic accident experiment.

262
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:55.510
What?

263
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.250
Hit a car with a doll that looks

264
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.850
like Ryo-chan?

265
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.810
A doll that looks like Ryo-

266
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.910
chan?

267
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.430
I won't let you do that!

268
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.030
That's what that stubborn manager is thinking.

269
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.870
He's going to turn my grudge

270
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.710
into a doll and make me angry.

271
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.270
Who's stubborn?

272
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.390
That stubborn manager.

273
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.110
No, no, no.

274
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.230
He's saying he wants to eat the

275
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.330
stubborn man.

276
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.770
He's so pathetic and boring.

277
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.410
No, no, no.

278
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.090
He's so energetic and I'm so

279
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.390
glad.

280
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.110
You said you were going to read the

281
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.190
book, the traffic safety training, for tomorrow's

282
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.510
training, right?

283
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.390
That's right.

284
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.970
I'm sure you'll come tomorrow, Y

285
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:29.310
otsu.

286
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.690
Of course.

287
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.590
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

288
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.370
I wonder if I'll be able to

289
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:33.790
sleep tonight.

290
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.310
I'm going to make you do a

291
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.610
lot of good work.

292
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.470
What's with that creepy laugh?

293
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:57.040
Is Yotsu still not here?

294
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.440
He ran away, didn't he, Almina?

295
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.540
I'm sure he'll come.

296
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.420
Even if he complains, he won't

297
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.500
disobey you.

298
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.540
It's that guy.

299
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.560
He looks calm even when he's late.

300
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.780
Maybe he skipped class.

301
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.100
I'm sure he'll come with a

302
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.200
smile on his face.

303
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.880
I don't like his attitude.

304
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.200
Don't be so...

305
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.540
I'm sorry I'm late, Chief!

306
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.620
What were you doing, Yotsu?

307
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.020
What time do you think it is?

308
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.400
It's not my fault that the alarm

309
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.460
stopped suddenly.

310
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.480
Besides, my bike broke down and the bus

311
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:32.600
didn't come.

312
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.760
I had no choice but to run all

313
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.980
the way here.

314
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.740
It's true!

315
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:37.980
You idiot!

316
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.520
Don't blame others for everything!

317
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.660
Chief, the general public is watching.

318
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.320
I guess it can't be helped.

319
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.560
The alarm broke and the bus was late.

320
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.500
You've been studying the traffic rules, haven

321
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.200
't you, Yotsu?

322
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.600
Of course I have!

323
00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.000
I've been studying the traffic safety rules

324
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.520
from head to toe!

325
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.800
He's laughing!

326
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.260
Don't make fun of me!

327
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.360
Chief, don't make fun of him!

328
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.800
It's a good and nice idea to

329
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:18.900
teach everyone about the traffic rules.

330
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.720
It's okay.

331
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.260
You have your own role.

332
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.400
What are you up to, Chief?

333
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.440
I'm helping out, too.

334
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.220
It looks like it's going to be

335
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.440
a scary traffic safety week.

336
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.740
I wonder if it'll be okay.

337
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.480
We work day and night to protect the

338
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.000
public from traffic accidents and crimes.

339
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.080
We work day and night to protect the

340
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.480
public from traffic accidents and crimes.

341
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.560
I thought I'd be done by the

342
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:49.660
time you got here.

343
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.540
Let's start the next operation.

344
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.480
Hey, Honda!

345
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.580
Can you hear me?

346
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.400
I can't do that.

347
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.520
Besides, I'm on patrol.

348
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.460
I'm a little sluggish, but

349
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:04.840
...

350
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.880
Are you not listening to me?

351
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.220
Okay, I'll go.

352
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.880
All right, all right.

353
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.780
It can't be helped.

354
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.460
Wait a minute, Mr. Ryosu!

355
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.680
I'd like to take this opportunity to

356
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.440
...

357
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.880
It's not a karaoke for old men.

358
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.380
How long are you going to hold the

359
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:35.600
microphone?

360
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.780
I'll feel better if I hold it.

361
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.820
What can I do for you?

362
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.380
Get ready for the good boys' corner.

363
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:52.940
Good boys!

364
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.360
You're small, so it's hard to

365
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.000
see you from the driver's seat.

366
00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.580
Please be careful.

367
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.080
Yes!

368
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.280
Yes!

369
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.700
Boss, you're mad at me for showing

370
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:04.960
off.

371
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.400
When you cross the pedestrian crossing, raise your

372
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.780
hand and cross it.

373
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:11.720
Yes!

374
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.050
I'm going to throw up!

375
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.050
It's dangerous!

376
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.480
I don't know when the car will

377
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.520
jump out like this.

378
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.320
Let's be careful.

379
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:29.680
Yes!

380
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.720
Next is a bicycle accident, which is common

381
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.640
among elementary school students.

382
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.700
A bicycle accident is a traffic accident caused

383
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.220
by a truck.

384
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.420
Let's reenact the scene here.

385
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.140
Damn it!

386
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.860
What's so sad that I have to

387
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.620
dress like this?

388
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:50.880
Hey!

389
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.280
You can't call me an elementary school

390
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:52.380
student.

391
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.880
Kankichi-kun!

392
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.120
I'm sorry.

393
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.920
All right, all right.

394
00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.380
In the case of a left turn, In

395
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.980
the case of a right turn, Please be

396
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.300
careful of bicycles, especially large trucks.

397
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.220
At intersections like this, when a large truck

398
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.300
turns, Mr. Nairin may hit this

399
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.780
boy or this boy.

400
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.300
I'm going to use this boy to

401
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.240
practice, so please watch carefully.

402
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.340
Boss!

403
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.140
Don't hit me!

404
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.140
I'm not the boss.

405
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.640
I'm the driver of a large truck.

406
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.820
I'm the driver of a large truck.

407
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.180
You have to act well, elementary school student.

408
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.900
All right, everyone.

409
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:30.740
Please pay attention to this guy.

410
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.240
Then I will act.

411
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.940
Mr. Nairin, when the car turns,

412
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.040
The rear tire slides inwards.

413
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.000
In this case, I will definitely pull that

414
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.400
boy.

415
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:45.540
Go!

416
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.900
Damn it!

417
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.180
I can't get caught in the boss

418
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.000
's trap so easily!

419
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.460
Please take a look.

420
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.380
Mr. Nairin comes out here and

421
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.020
hits the boy.

422
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.740
Boss!

423
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:57.920
I'm not the boss!

424
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.320
I'm not the boss!

425
00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.700
He dodged it on purpose.

426
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.740
At this rate, my position will be...

427
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.700
Damn it, Ryo-tsu!

428
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.260
Yes, that was a good example of how

429
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.319
to escape like this.

430
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.680
But if you think you can escape every

431
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.680
time, you're wrong.

432
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.560
Next, next is the real thing.

433
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.400
Take a look, Ryo-tsu.

434
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.900
I won't miss this time.

435
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.540
That's all for the fun.

436
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.220
I'll run away as many times as

437
00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:23.320
I want.

438
00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:24.920
I won't let the boss do as

439
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.020
he wants.

440
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.099
Let's go!

441
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.000
You need to be careful when you run

442
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.100
parallel to the truck.

443
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.520
Hey!

444
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.920
The bicycle runs faster than the truck!

445
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.260
Yes, it's to survive the traffic war!

446
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.000
Ouch!

447
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.220
Like this, it's not always that the

448
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.040
truck will run parallel to you.

449
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.660
Everyone, please be careful.

450
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.080
Everyone, don't do it!

451
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.000
Damn it!

452
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.840
The truck jumps, spins, and rushes in.

453
00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.020
How can it run parallel to me?

454
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.200
That's why!

455
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.160
It's like a child's fight.

456
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.300
I don't think it's a traffic

457
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.160
safety lesson.

458
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.600
Let's survive the traffic war, which we

459
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:13.700
don't know what will happen.

460
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.480
Yes!

461
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.760
Don't you know what will happen?

462
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.540
You're telling me, aren't you?

463
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.740
I'll teach you the meaning of

464
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.580
those words, boss!

465
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.920
Next is a 50cc motorcycle accident, which

466
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.020
happened to a woman.

467
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.960
Even though it's a 50cc scooter,

468
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.920
it's pretty fast, so please try to

469
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.340
ride it safely.

470
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:36.880
Thank you for waiting.

471
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.140
Huh?

472
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:39.520
Huh?

473
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.080
Boss!

474
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.180
Boss!

475
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.820
Please show me a good example of safe

476
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.160
driving.

477
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.940
Okay.

478
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.140
I've been waiting for this moment.

479
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.700
Now, get in!

480
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.620
Get in!

481
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.880
Be careful.

482
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.620
You're up to something, aren't you?

483
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.380
First, you should stand still.

484
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.620
Of course, don't forget to wear a

485
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:00.720
helmet.

486
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.080
Before you start the engine and start running,

487
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.180
make sure to...

488
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.200
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

489
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.500
Help me!

490
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.520
What's going on?

491
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.700
It started running on its own!

492
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.400
The handlebars and brakes aren't working!

493
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.420
Everyone!

494
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.700
This is a bad example of safe driving!

495
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:17.900
This scooter has been modified so that it

496
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.960
can be controlled by this radio controller.

497
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.900
What's going on?

498
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.280
What's wrong with this scooter?

499
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.080
Now!

500
00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:25.760
Honda!

501
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.640
Get in!

502
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.660
Roger!

503
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.420
I'm driving very safely today, too!

504
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.360
Honda!

505
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.880
Why are you here?

506
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.020
I'll show you how to drive!

507
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.460
It's all your fault!

508
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.900
Everyone, please don't drive like this.

509
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.860
Help me!

510
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.820
No one's listening.

511
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.080
They're all staring at Honda.

512
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.320
You idiots!

513
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.660
Honda!

514
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.680
Show us how to drive safely!

515
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.840
Now, let's see how this ugly doll

516
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.620
can drive in an even more dangerous situation.

517
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.840
Damn it!

518
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.940
Chief, you're trying to make a fool

519
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.280
of me, aren't you?

520
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.760
As you can see, even at a mere

521
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.580
20 kilometers per hour, there's a considerable

522
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.100
amount of damage.

523
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.200
Now, let's speed up and see how

524
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.920
far this doll can go.

525
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.340
Poor little doll!

526
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.440
It's as if I'm the one

527
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:42.820
who's in pain!

528
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.940
Chief.

529
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.760
Huh?

530
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.120
Are you sure you don't have to

531
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.380
say anything?

532
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:49.640
No.

533
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.700
I'm not the kind of guy who

534
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.540
would say anything!

535
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.400
Now, let's speed up to 60 kilometers

536
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:57.500
per hour.

537
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.680
Now, will that doll be able to hold

538
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:02.780
on?

539
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.460
Even though it's a doll, I'm

540
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.100
a little worried.

541
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.340
I don't care.

542
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.360
Take this!

543
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.300
Wait a minute!

544
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.060
Hey, the motorcycle's coming down from the

545
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.200
sky!

546
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.080
I don't know what's going to

547
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.920
happen, but it's a traffic war, isn

548
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.520
't it, Chief?

549
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.360
Damn you!

550
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.060
You're trying to get in the way

551
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.800
of the training session, aren't you?

552
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:24.820
Go!

553
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.260
Nakagawa!

554
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:26.680
Yes!

555
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.520
Damn you!

556
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.100
What are you doing?

557
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.000
Can't you catch up?

558
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.020
I can't.

559
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.960
If I do this, the motorcycle will have

560
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.260
an advantage.

561
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.360
What are you doing?

562
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.460
Hurry up and move on!

563
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.580
I can't.

564
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.460
There's oil on the roadside.

565
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.680
I can't move forward or turn.

566
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.460
What the hell?

567
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.360
Get out of the way!

568
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:57.620
Hey, look!

569
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.260
Traffic wars are scary, aren't they?

570
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.580
There's oil on the roadside all

571
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.720
of a sudden, isn't there?

572
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.020
Damn you, Ryotsu!

573
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.100
All right!

574
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.460
Let's finish this at once!

575
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.720
Are you sure, Mr. Ryotsu?

576
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.100
Why are you so scared?

577
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.480
If you're going to do it, do

578
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:16.880
it thoroughly!

579
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.460
OK!

580
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.160
Let's do it!

581
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.740
Let's dance!

582
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.140
Let's rock!

583
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.680
Let's do it!

584
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:32.960
Damn you!

585
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.740
What the hell are they?

586
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.080
Ryotsu!

587
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.160
What the hell is going on?

588
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.300
It's hard to watch!

589
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.320
Let's do it!

590
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.020
He's doing it!

591
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.640
Yes!

592
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.040
He's doing it at double speed!

593
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.840
He's doing it at full speed!

594
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.240
Did you see that?

595
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.280
If you do it, you can do it!

596
00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.980
This is the basic of the world!

597
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.680
No, it's not!

598
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.160
Damn you!

599
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.500
Come on!

600
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.220
The training session isn't over yet!

601
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.180
Thank you for your hard work.

602
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:22.520
The training session is over.

603
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.740
Now, we'll have the last performance.

604
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.120
Two police officers who are determined to win

605
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.880
will challenge each other to a shock test.

606
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.280
Please don't try this at home.

607
00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.300
Do it, Nakano!

608
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.280
Go all out at 100 km!

609
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.420
Are you sure?

610
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.580
I don't care!

611
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.420
Do it!

612
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.420
Chief!

613
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040
Help me!

614
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.600
Chief!

615
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.640
I'm sorry!

616
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.840
Help me!

617
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.780
I'm not a dummy doll!

618
00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:04.930
We did it!

619
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:06.130
Tomorrow, we'll have a party at Nak

620
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:06.630
agawa's house!

621
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.990
It's the birthday party of the prince

622
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.090
of the Honda Kingdom!

623
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.390
It's at Nakagawa's house!

624
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.310
There's no doubt that we'll have

625
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.430
a feast!

626
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.870
All right!

627
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.410
I won't eat anything from now on!

628
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.490
I'm going to eat to my heart

629
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:17.590
's content!

630
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.210
Next time, we'll have a look at

631
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.550
Nakagawa's otaku!

632
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:21.790
Don't miss it!
