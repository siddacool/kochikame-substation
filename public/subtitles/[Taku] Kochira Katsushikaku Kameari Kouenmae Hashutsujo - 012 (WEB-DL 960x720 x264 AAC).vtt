(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Summer has come again this year.

2
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.020
Summer has come again this year.

3
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.340
A big wave is coming, a big wave

4
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.580
is coming.

5
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.439
The south wind is blowing.

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.260
A big ship is coming, a big ship

7
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.540
is coming.

8
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.120
A big ship is coming.

9
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.900
Summer has come again this year.

10
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.780
Summer has come again this year.

11
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.000
A big wave is coming, a big wave

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.260
is coming.

13
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.160
The south wind is blowing.

14
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.820
A big butt is coming, a big butt

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.140
is coming.

16
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.390
A big wave!

17
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.850
The Edo-Kogashi

18
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:51.680
War Leave

19
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.440
it to me.

20
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.380
A lot of amigos are coming

21
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.480
out.

22
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.420
It is very lively.

23
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.440
It's natural for the festival to be

24
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.780
lively.

25
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.860
It's only natural, isn't it?

26
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.160
It's going to be even more lively

27
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.140
from now on.

28
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.360
Ah, Reiko-san!

29
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.840
The festival is about to begin.

30
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420
That's quite a number of mikoshi.

31
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.340
That's right.

32
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.420
We're going to race to the shrine

33
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.240
up ahead and see which one of us

34
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.340
will be the Edokko of Ed

35
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.540
okko.

36
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.280
It's the main event of today's

37
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.380
festival.

38
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.120
Oh, they're here!

39
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.160
Over here!

40
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.740
You're late, Ryo-san!

41
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.580
Sorry, sorry.

42
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.040
I was so worried you wouldn't come.

43
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.980
It's true!

44
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.860
Because thanks to Ryo-san, our

45
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.000
choukai has been in the

46
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.960
top spot for three consecutive years.

47
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.620
Ryo-san is now like a

48
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.480
great Edokko master.

49
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.880
Is that so?

50
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.260
That's right.

51
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.900
Edokko of Edokko.

52
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.920
Ryo-san, Edokko number

53
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.380
one!

54
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.280
Super Edokko Ryo-san!

55
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.460
Yo!

56
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.600
The best Edokko in the universe!

57
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.060
It feels good to be told the truth.

58
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.200
That guy's an Edokko?

59
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.940
Huh?

60
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.800
You're making me laugh.

61
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.420
It seems like he's happy to be

62
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.520
praised for his jealousy.

63
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.280
I can't say he's the real

64
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.800
Edokko.

65
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.480
What?

66
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.040
I haven't seen you before.

67
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.420
What's your choukai?

68
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.680
This guy is called Kin-san, the

69
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.780
Edokko of Edokko.

70
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.160
He's our choukai's

71
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.540
assistant.

72
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.880
What did you say?

73
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.240
I can't let you guys do big

74
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.140
things every year.

75
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.280
You fake Edokko!

76
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.980
I'll skin you alive.

77
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.320
You're funny!

78
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.360
You too!

79
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.280
Don't make me laugh!

80
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:17.589
Edokko of Edokko He

81
00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.149
's not even worth talking about.

82
00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.350
I knew it.

83
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.030
He's not Edokko.

84
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.350
No, no.

85
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.970
No one can beat Osage.

86
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.830
I'll look down on everyone from above

87
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.930
my head.

88
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.190
This is Edokko!

89
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.550
I'll let you say that.

90
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.130
Hey, Ryo-san!

91
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.370
If you're Edokko, you should

92
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.890
stand on your head.

93
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.790
You're sitting on your head.

94
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.190
You're overdoing it.

95
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.970
Yeah, you should stand on one leg.

96
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.250
Edokko likes to stand on one

97
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.730
leg.

98
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.210
So that's how it is.

99
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.390
This is a nice view.

100
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.850
I don't know this guy, so I

101
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.230
can't call myself Edokko.

102
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.610
Don't even stand on your head.

103
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.010
I'm Edokko.

104
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.170
Like this.

105
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.710
This is the original Edokko.

106
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.690
This is the ultimate Edokko.

107
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.870
Are you all right, Ryo-san?

108
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.330
He's already in the lead.

109
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.990
Ryo-san's got a weird

110
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.230
position.

111
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.310
That's right.

112
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.430
He's going to win.

113
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.790
Shut up!

114
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.750
Then I have no choice but to do

115
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.850
it.

116
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.050
Okay, let's go!

117
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.650
It's a shortcut!

118
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.250
You can't lose!

119
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.610
This is also a shortcut!

120
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.850
Wow!

121
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.610
That was great!

122
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.770
That's not good!

123
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.110
Don't follow me!

124
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.790
You're the one who's running in

125
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.490
front of us!

126
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.930
Damn it!

127
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.610
He's going to beat us up!

128
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.770
Let's speed up!

129
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.290
Don't let him get away!

130
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.250
Chase him!

131
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.670
Chase him!

132
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.780
There's only one left!

133
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.160
I'm the number one Edokko!

134
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.160
I'm going to beat him up!

135
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.460
Okay, I got it!

136
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.860
Idiot!

137
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.100
Slow down!

138
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.980
You're going to hit the shrine!

139
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.320
You shouldn't have said that!

140
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.560
I can't stop him!

141
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.780
I forgot!

142
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.830
Damn it!

143
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.170
Idiot!

144
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.750
Are you okay?

145
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.310
Damn it!

146
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.170
I lost the championship four years in a

147
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.270
row.

148
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.530
I broke the shrine and the shrine maiden.

149
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.950
I'm going to get wet!

150
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.370
It's terrible!

151
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.590
It's all his fault!

152
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.870
It's all his fault!

153
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.110
Damn it!

154
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.250
Are you going to take a bath, too?

155
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.870
It's up to me where I'm

156
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:15.970
going to take a bath!

157
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.350
Senpai!

158
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.490
I'm going to beat you up!

159
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.030
I don't feel like giving up.

160
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.830
I'm going to beat you up!

161
00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:39.830
Ryo, you're going to catch a

162
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.130
fish, right?

163
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.630
I got number one!

164
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.390
It's 370 yen.

165
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.610
I don't need a fish today!

166
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.410
I knew it!

167
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.570
You're number one, Edokko!

168
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.350
I won't let you!

169
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.430
I'm number one!

170
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.590
Senpai, what was that scream?

171
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.830
Scream?

172
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.390
I didn't hear a scream.

173
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.430
It's your imagination, isn't it?

174
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.190
But...

175
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.750
It's your imagination!

176
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.590
Um...

177
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.130
Aren't you going to take the first

178
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.490
bath?

179
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.130
What?

180
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.810
I was just thinking about taking a bath.

181
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.370
Oh, me too!

182
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.170
Ryo?

183
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.910
Don't shake it!

184
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.510
The water's going to evaporate!

185
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.470
That way!

186
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.050
Nakagawa!

187
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.650
Help me with the boiler!

188
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.810
The water's going to evaporate!

189
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.030
What?

190
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.790
You're going to raise the temperature?

191
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.750
Yeah, it's still warm.

192
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.370
That's strange.

193
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.110
I was going to make it pretty hot.

194
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.070
It's starting to warm up a little.

195
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.950
It's starting to warm up?

196
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.970
Don't make me laugh.

197
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.790
It's still warm for you, Edok

198
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.890
ko.

199
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.530
Nakagawa!

200
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.070
It's not warming up at all!

201
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.950
Add more firewood!

202
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.610
It's still warm?

203
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.670
Hot!

204
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.770
Hot!

205
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.790
It's over 60 degrees!

206
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.010
That's not the temperature a human can

207
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.470
take in!

208
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.510
I said it's warm, so it's

209
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:50.770
warm!

210
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.110
I don't know what 60 degrees is!

211
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.550
Edokko, you're still like ice

212
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.850
water!

213
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.570
Go back to the boiler!

214
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.570
I understand.

215
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.850
It's so warm!

216
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.290
My nose is running!

217
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.890
Do something, Nakagawa!

218
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.570
Yes, sir!

219
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.080
I'm using Nakagawa's i

220
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.180
ce.

221
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.900
I can heat it up to 10,000

222
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.160
degrees.

223
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.300
I see.

224
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.300
10,000 degrees...

225
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.900
I love this foam!

226
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.020
I don't feel like I'm in

227
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.320
the bath unless I see the water boiling.

228
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.980
Nakagawa, the water's boiling, so

229
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.840
don't make a fuss.

230
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.800
It's still warm for you, Edok

231
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:04.900
ko.

232
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.640
Watch out!

233
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.400
Senpai!

234
00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.000
Senpai!

235
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.680
Senpai!

236
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.820
Senpai!

237
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.060
Are you all right?

238
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.900
I'm not Edokko unless I

239
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.000
explode!

240
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.020
I'm sure of it!

241
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.920
I'm sure of it!

242
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.400
Ryo, did you wake up?

243
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.100
No, not yet.

244
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.560
I bought you sushi.

245
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.260
What?

246
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:00.960
Sushi?

247
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.460
Senpai, did you wake up?

248
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.640
Yes, I woke up from the word sushi.

249
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.520
Edokko doesn't have eyes for

250
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:08.620
sushi.

251
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.180
As expected of you, Senpai.

252
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.680
It doesn't matter, but at least take

253
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.020
off your pants.

254
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.380
It's not delicacy.

255
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.760
That's not in my dictionary.

256
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.300
It's not in my dictionary.

257
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.320
Let's eat!

258
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.900
What's wrong, Senpai?

259
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.100
What is this sushi?

260
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.840
It's an avocado roll.

261
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.060
Avocado?

262
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.140
It's sushi from the west coast of

263
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.240
America.

264
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.700
It's healthy and very popular.

265
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.000
The west coast of America?

266
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.980
Healthy?

267
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.280
Are you kidding me?

268
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.080
How do you know it's sushi from

269
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.200
the west coast of Edo?

270
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.460
It's from the west coast of E

271
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:51.560
do.

272
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.440
It's made from fish caught in the

273
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:52.820
Tokyo Bay.

274
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.900
That's why it's called sushi from

275
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.120
the west coast of Edo.

276
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.160
This isn't real sushi.

277
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.380
What are you doing, Ryo?

278
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.620
It's too much, Senpai.

279
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.020
Reiko bought it for you.

280
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.180
Even so, I can only eat sushi from

281
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.420
the west coast of Edo.

282
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.940
Then let me eat real sushi from the

283
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.580
west coast of Edo.

284
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.020
I want to compare real sushi from the

285
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:22.540
west coast of Edo with the sushi

286
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:22.940
I bought.

287
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.540
If I don't compare them, I won

288
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.500
't be able to accept your attitude.

289
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.920
Okay.

290
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.160
I'll take you there.

291
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
I'll take you there.

292
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.400
I wonder what kind of sushi he'll

293
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.140
make me eat.

294
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.640
I'm looking forward to it.

295
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.240
It's my first time to be treated

296
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.340
by you, Senpai.

297
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.860
Darn it.

298
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:55.960
This is unexpected.

299
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.760
I'll go over there.

300
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.700
Senpai, where are you going?

301
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.140
I'm almost there.

302
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.820
You're not going to eat sushi from

303
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.700
the west coast of Edo, are you?

304
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.960
I was wondering who you were.

305
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.600
You look like you're from the west

306
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.100
coast of Edo.

307
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.280
Are you from Hirumano?

308
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.640
You're Ryo-chan's opponent?

309
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.220
You're from a sushi restaurant?

310
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:23.880
Yes.

311
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.560
I've been eating sushi from the west

312
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.240
coast of Edo for 500 years.

313
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.720
Since Toyotomi Hideyoshi was

314
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.780
still in Hiyoshimaru, I

315
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.820
've been eating sushi from this restaurant which

316
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.860
has been in Tokugawa Iey

317
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.760
asu's favor.

318
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.000
Let's go, Nakagawa Reiko.

319
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.700
My brain will rot if I play with

320
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.440
such a big guy.

321
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.620
Hey, hey.

322
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.280
You're not going to eat sushi from

323
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.100
the west coast of Edo, are you?

324
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.840
It's up to me where I go.

325
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.240
Darn it.

326
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.440
I'm in Edo now.

327
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.440
I'm going to eat sushi from the

328
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.700
west coast of Edo.

329
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.200
Hey, Senpai.

330
00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.200
Isn't it that restaurant?

331
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.180
It's not that one.

332
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.100
I'm going to this restaurant.

333
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.260
You're going to satisfy us, aren't

334
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:06.360
you?

335
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.100
Hey, Sushiya.

336
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.140
Hey, you.

337
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.260
If you wake up, I'm going to

338
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:09.800
eat the real thing.

339
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.260
Well, what should I eat?

340
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.580
This kind of restaurant is expensive.

341
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.720
I'm going to eat something cheap.

342
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.700
There's a delicious sea urchin, Miss.

343
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.860
Then, I'm going to eat that.

344
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.680
What?

345
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.760
What's wrong?

346
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.920
No, it's nothing.

347
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.940
What should I eat?

348
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.440
There's a good toro, Miss.

349
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.940
Then, toro.

350
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.860
Hey, old man.

351
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:45.740
What?

352
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.240
Do you want to know what's in

353
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.340
my wallet?

354
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.540
That's no good.

355
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.420
A real Edo boy doesn't have

356
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:51.660
money to get drunk.

357
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.800
Don't be stupid.

358
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.480
I'm...

359
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.340
Where's the bathroom?

360
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.400
Over there.

361
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.920
That sea urchin and toro alone

362
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.600
are worth 5,000 yen.

363
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.160
Even if I order cheap stuff from now

364
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.079
on, 20,000 yen is a little too

365
00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:09.260
much.

366
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.000
I think I should do something about this

367
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.940
and get out of here.

368
00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:16.819
Hey, wait.

369
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.240
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.060
Saku-kun.

371
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.300
This guy.

372
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.820
He's just talking about expensive stuff again.

373
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.160
If it's like this...

374
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.380
Old man, I'd like half a bottle

375
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:33.660
of maki.

376
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:34.660
Yes.

377
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.080
Kanpyo maki.

378
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.560
Here you go.

379
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.120
The cheapest kanpyo maki in

380
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.220
the world.

381
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.520
Please wait.

382
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.500
I'm going to put a lot of

383
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.440
special sauce on it.

384
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.540
Huh?

385
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.980
What's this?

386
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.540
It's kanpyo maki.

387
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.380
Oh, this is kanpyo maki?

388
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.220
There's no seaweed, and there's only

389
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.560
one kanpyo.

390
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.840
Can an Edo boy eat such a

391
00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.380
thin toro?

392
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.100
It's been around for 500 years.

393
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.460
Can you hear me?

394
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.640
This isn't real sushi.

395
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.040
Let's go, Reiko Nakagawa.

396
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120
Yes, sir.

397
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:10.780
What about the money?

398
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.960
There's a 50% discount on the

399
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.060
sign.

400
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.580
You don't have to pay for fake

401
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.080
sushi.

402
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.280
Mission accomplished.

403
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.480
Wait a minute, Giku.

404
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.420
That kanpyo maki is just

405
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.020
an appetizer.

406
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.280
This is the real kanpyo mak

407
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:28.380
i.

408
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.280
That's right.

409
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.620
The kanpyo maki in front

410
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.700
of Edo isn't this big.

411
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.820
I'm glad you said that.

412
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.840
You're pretty good.

413
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.620
I'll make you do whatever you want.

414
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.880
So, what are we doing next?

415
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.960
Well, I'm going to get a sea

416
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.920
urchin, too.

417
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.640
What?

418
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.140
A sea urchin army roll?

419
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.560
No, it's a sea urchin spaceship

420
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.200
roll.

421
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.960
A sea urchin spaceship roll?

422
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.680
You can't do it?

423
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.060
What?

424
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.640
There's nothing I can't do.

425
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.460
Wait a minute.

426
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.080
A sea urchin spaceship roll...

427
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.580
This is it.

428
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.860
Yes, sir.

429
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.420
How about a sea urchin spaceship roll?

430
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.020
What's this?

431
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.840
It's a seal and a kanpy

432
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:30.940
o.

433
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.020
It'll look cool later.

434
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:33.960
You idiot!

435
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.920
There's no way there's only one

436
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.020
seal on a battleship.

437
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.180
This is a space destroyer roll.

438
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.300
You've got it a little wrong.

439
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.380
It's just that there aren't many

440
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.140
customers who order a sea urchin spaceship

441
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.580
roll.

442
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.360
This is the real deal.

443
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.720
A sea urchin spaceship roll.

444
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:53.820
What?

445
00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.710
This is it.

446
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:00.070
What's this?

447
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.970
If I don't eat this, I don

448
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:02.070
't feel like I've come to a

449
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.650
sushi restaurant.

450
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.690
As expected of a sea urchin.

451
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.610
You're right.

452
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.430
Then I'll have you eat it in

453
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.910
one bite.

454
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:10.170
What?

455
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.050
Sea urchins are supposed to be

456
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:13.470
eaten in one bite, right?

457
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.050
Of course.

458
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.370
What should I serve next?

459
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.770
Let's see.

460
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.550
Let's get something to eat.

461
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.150
There's nothing I can't do.

462
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.390
That's right.

463
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.210
A shrimp-shaped rice ball.

464
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.670
A leaf-shaped roll.

465
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.790
Curry rice.

466
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.630
Curry rice.

467
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.670
A salmon and salmon roe rice ball.

468
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.670
Here we go.

469
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.250
A tuna rice ball.

470
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.030
Here we go.

471
00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.610
It's completely rainbow-colored.

472
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.050
He's like a child.

473
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.590
What should I serve next?

474
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:06.810
There's more to come.

475
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.490
That's right.

476
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.710
Then I'll have octopus dance.

477
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.010
It's alive.

478
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.710
Octopus is dancing on the rice ball.

479
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.570
This is exactly octopus dance.

480
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.930
Eat it while it's fresh.

481
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:24.950
Thank you.

482
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.830
I'll have to eat this edib

483
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.290
le squid.

484
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.410
You seem to be out of breath.

485
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.350
I caught it.

486
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.990
I ate it.

487
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.490
I'll take it.

488
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.130
2 million yen.

489
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.610
Is it expensive?

490
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.490
No, it's not.

491
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.770
I was surprised because it was so cheap.

492
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.430
Of course, I'll pay you in cash.

493
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.210
Because I'm from Edo.

494
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.910
I'll get the money.

495
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.330
Wait a minute.

496
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:53.610
I'll be right back.

497
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:13.820
I'm sorry, but

498
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.460
I only have small ones.

499
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.400
Can you count them?

500
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.800
I'm glad.

501
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.000
I thought you wanted a small one.

502
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.940
I thought you'd say that.

503
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.100
I'm glad.

504
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.780
You're wrong.

505
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.340
They're not laughing at all.

506
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.660
I want you to be moderate.

507
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.900
Why are Reiko and I connected by

508
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.120
hand?

509
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.060
I don't have a key.

510
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.920
Then Reiko and I will live like

511
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.800
this for the rest of our lives.

512
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:15.920
I don't want that.

513
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.920
Next time, Ryotsu and Re

514
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.060
iko.

515
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:19.860
Thank you.
