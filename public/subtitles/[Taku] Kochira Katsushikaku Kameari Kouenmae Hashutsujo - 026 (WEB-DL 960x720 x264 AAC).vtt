00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.080
Oh, yes.

187
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.720
Terrible.

188
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.260
I-I guess so.

189
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.560
This place might give the viewers a sense

190
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.320
of superiority, but...

191
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.440
Do you really live here every day?

192
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.860
Of course.

193
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.420
Now, don't be shy.

194
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.020
Come upstairs.

195
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.120
I'll make you some tea.

196
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.060
No, thank you.

197
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.820
First, from the bed.

198
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.700
Aim here with a low-pos

199
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:54.800
ition.

200
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.180
And then, pan up.

201
00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.580
Twist your head from above.

202
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.400
And then, to the screen.

203
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.660
This is why amateurs have a hard

204
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:04.760
time.

205
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.540
You can't have such an unnatural camera

206
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:06.940
angle.

207
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.800
Right, Sugihara-chan?

208
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.440
Y-Yes, you're right.

209
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.880
Shut up, director!

210
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880
What?

211
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.880
Even a lively fish can't hit a

212
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.540
weak board.

213
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.740
It's a disaster.

214
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.920
Let me see.

215
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.500
Um...

216
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.500
Are you going to sleep in this fut

217
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:26.640
on?

218
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.240
I can't sleep in my uniform.

219
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.100
Take off your jacket.

220
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.300
Um...

221
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.140
Where are my pajamas?

222
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.100
Pajamas?

223
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.380
That kind of thing.

224
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.640
Oh, that's right.

225
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.380
I think...

226
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.160
Your butt...

227
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.480
No, no, no!

228
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.340
Well, that's how it is.

229
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.880
The police officer is on standby in his

230
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.580
own shirt.

231
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.040
Like this?

232
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.840
Something's not right.

233
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.640
Hey, Eddie!

234
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.340
Huh?

235
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.840
It's you, you!

236
00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:58.680
Me?

237
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.100
What did you say?

238
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.480
Yamamoto-chan!

239
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.040
Hold on tight here.

240
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:03.840
Okay.

241
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.100
Put that over there.

242
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.240
And that over there.

243
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.200
And put that over there.

244
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.180
Okay.

245
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.120
No, no!

246
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.000
You can't just line them up!

247
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.660
Hey, Nanana!

248
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.260
Reach out your hand.

249
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:23.760
Oh, okay.

250
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.940
Everything is within reach.

251
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.000
And then, a picture of a beautiful

252
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.480
woman.

253
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.300
And then, a picture of a beautiful woman.

254
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.700
Well, this is realism.

255
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.720
By the way, Yamamoto Eddie.

256
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.720
Yes, sir!

257
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.060
Don't you think something's missing?

258
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.420
Huh?

259
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.940
You're a pathetic guy.

260
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.180
You don't even know this?

261
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.180
No!

262
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.720
It's a pig.

263
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.940
A pig?

264
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.680
Go buy a pig!

265
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:58.600
Hurry!

266
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.380
Why don't you buy one for me?

267
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.340
A pig in the winter?

268
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.520
You don't know what's inside.

269
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.540
A summer wind chime on a winter window.

270
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.560
A winter kotatsu on a mids

271
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.180
ummer table.

272
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:12.940
That's the pity of a single

273
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.440
man.

274
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.420
With this, my wife's tears will be

275
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.660
squeezed tight.

276
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.840
Um, what's the rate?

277
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.720
I think it's about 3% up.

278
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.910
I think it's about 3% up.

279
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.120
Oh, my eyes are bleeding.

280
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.240
Standby, okay!

281
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.440
Oh, I slept well.

282
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.420
The weather is nice today, too.

283
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.360
Cut!

284
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.520
Why?

285
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.680
There's no commoner who has such

286
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:48.820
a good face when he wakes up.

287
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.560
There's no such thing as a head

288
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:53.940
lotion.

289
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.180
There's no such thing as a head

290
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:55.280
lotion.

291
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.020
Use the oil left in the frying pan

292
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.480
to make your eyes look like this.

293
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.580
Soak your eyes in hot water and

294
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.920
make them red and swollen.

295
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.800
It hurts.

296
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.000
It's a little swollen.

297
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.860
Um, Ryo-chan.

298
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.240
That's enough.

299
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.620
Don't disturb the production team!

300
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.840
The finish is a wake-up fashion.

301
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.140
Because of the budget...

302
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.720
It hurts more than this.

303
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.340
This is also part of the job.

304
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:26.740
Nagagawa!

305
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.900
All right!

306
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.400
The reality has come out!

307
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.580
Listen!

308
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.140
I'll only do it once, so look

309
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.420
closely.

310
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.280
Yes!

311
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.410
Shut up!

312
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.250
Good morning.

313
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:45.690
I'm waking up.

314
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.730
Did you see that?

315
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.550
This is the human wake-

316
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.650
up.

317
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.370
Try it!

318
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.230
Yes!

319
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.290
No, no!

320
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.730
You're still a rich man like me.

321
00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:11.730
Why do you have to do this?

322
00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.869
That's what you think, right?

323
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.750
No, that's not it.

324
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.829
After all, the level of life is different

325
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:20.730
from the commoner, baby.

326
00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.349
I can see your unyielding

327
00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:23.930
pride!

328
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.990
That's not what I meant.

329
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.770
Get out of here, Nakagawa!

330
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:28.970
The status of the Nagagawa

331
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.850
Taibatsu's benefactor...

332
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.710
And the pride of being the second one!

333
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.790
Throw everything away and become a rich man!

334
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.190
It's a tough production.

335
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.010
Well, I lost.

336
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.050
Good morning.

337
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.010
I'm a rich man.

338
00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.990
It's cold this morning, too.

339
00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:54.710
I'm going to puke!

340
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.260
It stinks!

341
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.920
Why is there a mold?

342
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.400
Oh, this is good.

343
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.720
I see.

344
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.140
When I ate ramen, I wiped it with

345
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.560
this...

346
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.940
And it was aged as it was.

347
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.040
Well, in a week or two...

348
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.280
Why does this look so good?

349
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.320
I'm sorry, senpai.

350
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.700
I can't poop.

351
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.000
Cut!

352
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:36.720
Okay!

353
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.720
Well, aside from your fart...

354
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.260
You've gotten a lot better, Nakag

355
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:42.920
awa, as a person.

356
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.960
With this, the viewer rating is 5%

357
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.420
for sure.

358
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.600
Now, it's a matter of time

359
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:47.920
...

360
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.920
To see how much content the viewers like.

361
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.860
Poor Nakagawa, the police officer...

362
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.860
He finds a trash can to pay for

363
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:04.960
his meal.

364
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.820
Hey, over there!

365
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.740
Kind Nakagawa...

366
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.400
Gives the fried chicken bento he

367
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.600
picked up for dinner...

368
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.940
To the dog.

369
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.140
With this, he grabs the dog's heart

370
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:20.800
...

371
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.640
And the viewer rating is 1%!

372
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.080
Nakagawa...

373
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.360
Is also a child-like brother.

374
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.600
With this, he grabs the wife and child

375
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.120
's heart...

376
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.960
And the viewer rating is 1%!

377
00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.800
In front of Kameari Park...

378
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.720
There's a great boss named Yots

379
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.420
u Junsa-cho.

380
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.480
Nakagawa-kun, who's hungry

381
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.580
...

382
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.980
Sometimes, he feeds him ramen.

383
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.100
With the appearance of ramen, the viewer rating

384
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.860
is 10%!

385
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.620
What's going on, Ryo-chan?

386
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.480
That's not it!

387
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.140
Then, the camera is too high!

388
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.640
I'll take it!

389
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.440
Okay, Reiko.

390
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.920
Walk straight ahead.

391
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.260
I don't want to!

392
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:14.440
Come on!

393
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.060
Don't aim too low.

394
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.460
And then, Nakagawa goes into the

395
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:20.560
frame!

396
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:21.940
Rain!

397
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:22.480
Yes!

398
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.540
A sexy beauty and

399
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.440
her second partner.

400
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.340
What's the viewer rating?

401
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.900
He grabs Yume-no-S

402
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.520
ou...

403
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.560
And the viewer rating is 5%!

404
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.320
What time is it?

405
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.180
It's 4.

406
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:37.500
30.

407
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.080
Okay, we're almost there!

408
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.780
That's...

409
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.260
A smiling old lady.

410
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.060
Go, Nakagawa!

411
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.480
Mom!

412
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.620
It's you, Mom!

413
00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.120
It's me!

414
00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.400
It's Keiichi!

415
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.740
What are you talking about?

416
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.260
I don't remember you!

417
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.400
Ryo-san, what are you doing

418
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:10.500
there?

419
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.530
Director, could it be...

420
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.940
The old lady is hopeless.

421
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.720
The reaction of an amateur is life.

422
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.080
The old lady's lines are over-

423
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.180
the-top.

424
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.060
What's the percentage of the reunion with

425
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:24.160
her mother?

426
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.240
18% of national tears and emotions.

427
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.780
Then, the total viewer rating is 40%

428
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.940
times 100,000.

429
00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.460
4 million!

430
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.220
What are you doing, Nakagawa?

431
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.880
Nakagawa is in tears.

432
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.720
Next...

433
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.200
We'll start the battle.

434
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.340
Sometimes, you'll accidentally fall into a deep

435
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:46.480
sleep.

436
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.620
Let's see...

437
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.920
Soap, soap, and...

438
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.740
There it is!

439
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.380
Shampoo!

440
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.300
Lucky!

441
00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.080
It's still there.

442
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.000
It's common sense to use both soap

443
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.680
and shampoo.

444
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.800
It's common sense to use both soap

445
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:03.900
and shampoo.

446
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.600
Finally, we'll finish with fruit milk.

447
00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.180
It's the climax!

448
00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.420
Common sense.

449
00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:12.920
This is how Nakagawa spends his

450
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.200
day.

451
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.470
Well done, Nakagawa.

452
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.910
You've become a commoner.

453
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.030
That's too much.

454
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.750
Poor Keiichi.

455
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.250
This is a different person.

456
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:44.470
It's not me!

457
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.790
It's not me!

458
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:46.670
Mr. Nakagawa!

459
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:48.090
Mr. Ryoichi!

460
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.170
And so...

461
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.210
Right after the show aired, Nakagawa

462
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.790
received a lot of letters, faxes, and

463
00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.030
envelopes from all over the country.

464
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.690
Nakagawa is really good at acting.

465
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.490
I've deceived the public.

466
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.830
What should I do?

467
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:09.630
Oh, that's right.

468
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.790
By the way, what's the viewer rating?

469
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.910
It's 30%.

470
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.470
I see.

471
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.230
That means...

472
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.370
I'll get 3 million yen.

473
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.150
And...

474
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.690
Ryoichi was the director, but he

475
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.490
's a playwright.

476
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.990
I don't need someone who's not

477
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.750
as good as an amateur.

478
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.250
Both of you...

479
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.710
You're fired.

480
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.330
So you don't get any money.

481
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.830
What?

482
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.830
Mr. Nakagawa!

483
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.550
Mr. Nakagawa!

484
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.470
So you're the one who did

485
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.690
that show!

486
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.150
That's the result of Nakagawa

487
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:45.870
's sweat and tears!

488
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.090
Right?

489
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.970
But you forced me to do it.

490
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.410
Mr. Nakagawa, I'm glad you

491
00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:53.510
did it.

492
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.990
You're...

493
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.430
an idiot!

494
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.150
Who are you?

495
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.230
This man who looks like a brand

496
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.130
item is...

497
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.090
Super Rich Shiratori Reiji!

498
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.990
You fell in love with Reiko and

499
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.530
followed her to the police station?

500
00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.350
Hey, Reiko!

501
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.610
Do something about this dangerous guy!

502
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.710

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.970

I'm looking forward to it!

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:37.810
I stop the clock Time will pass So

507
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:45.670
