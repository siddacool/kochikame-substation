(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Receiving the wind of the coming season

2
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.620
The shining, brightest carnival Lightly crossing

3
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:36.680
the rough times Diving to the city

4
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.040
alone I wanna dive in paradise Rather than

5
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.100
looking at all the fashionable

6
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.660
things I'd rather be honest Let it

7
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.100
rip!

8
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.740
Everybody can do!

9
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.620
I started running My dream never stops I

10
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.760
don't regret tomorrow Let it rip!

11
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.400
Everybody can do!

12
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.280
I don't want to see you I

13
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.600
'm excited, I'm excited I'm strong,

14
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:30.170
I'm strong With Mr.

15
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.630
Zou I'm excited, I'm excited

16
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.410
Well, the game is until 10.

17
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.810
30.

18
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.490
No, wait, I'll make it until 11.

19
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.730
What have you been doing?

20
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.550
What, Nakagawa?

21
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.550
I thought it was Director Ohara.

22
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.430
I'm on leave tomorrow, so I'm

23
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.170
going to make a tight schedule and spend

24
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.110
a meaningful day.

25
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.150
It's really a precious face, except for

26
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.250
work.

27
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.290
Of course.

28
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.450
There aren't many days off for work,

29
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.250
so I'd like to have at least

30
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.410
five days off a week.

31
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.990
I'd like to have two days off

32
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.090
a week.

33
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.949
I'm working hard for the safety of

34
00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:08.049
the citizens.

35
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.990
It's a matter of course.

36
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.610
In your case, it's always seven days

37
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.710
a week.

38
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.290
But if I have to do all this

39
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.810
tight schedule, I need the stamina of the

40
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.910
Iron Man.

41
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.390
Yes, this is Kameari.

42
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.630
Huh?

43
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.550
What is it?

44
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.210
We're taking a break here.

45
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.670
We'll have lunch and lunch break.

46
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.790
Senpai, we're in trouble!

47
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.050
It's dangerous!

48
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.190
Please step back!

49
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.990
Please step back!

50
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.350
It's dangerous here!

51
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.910
You can't go in there!

52
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.070
Please don't go in there!

53
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.710
Please step back!

54
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.090
It's dangerous, so please step back!

55
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.190
Listen, this is what happens when you get

56
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.290
caught!

57
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.850
Move, move!

58
00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.670
Too slow!

59
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.210
Excuse me!

60
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.270
Mr. Nakagawa!

61
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.250
Any witnesses?

62
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.190
None!

63
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.630
So, where's the statue?

64
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.500
It's in the back warehouse.

65
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.480
Hurry up and catch it!

66
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.860
That's right!

67
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.400
You're used to it!

68
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.440
I'm not used to it!

69
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.140
The statue...

70
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.020
I'll go with you!

71
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.000
Mr. Nakagawa, it's dangerous!

72
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.100
What's that?

73
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.820
It's discrimination!

74
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.060
It's discrimination.

75
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.740
Now, hurry up and go!

76
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.240
Here you go.

77
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.440
I don't need anything.

78
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.960
What's this?

79
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.240
It's a kid.

80
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.260
Hey, Zou-chan, it's okay.

81
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.480
It's quiet.

82
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.460
I wonder if it's okay.

83
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.420
Senpai!

84
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.140
It's dangerous, Mr. Nakagawa!

85
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.540
Let me go!

86
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.740
Senpai!

87
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.380
Let me go!

88
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.900
Nakagawa, hurry up and bring milk

89
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.300
and breast milk!

90
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.300
Hurry up!

91
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.480
Yes, sir!

92
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.920
Hey, Mr. Nakagawa!

93
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.900
Mr. Nakagawa!

94
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.400
I'm glad you're okay!

95
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.180
Excuse me, do you have milk and breast

96
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.300
milk?

97
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.500
Yes.

98
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.720
Ouch!

99
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.040
There, there.

100
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.700
You don't have to be afraid.

101
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.860
Just fill your stomach.

102
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.940
Then you'll probably calm down.

103
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.760
There, there.

104
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.220
Not yet, Nakagawa.

105
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.940
You're so clumsy.

106
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.540
I'm done!

107
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.080
Do you drink milk?

108
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.760
Milk is the basis of all milk.

109
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.880
Here, have some milk.

110
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.420
You're a cow's father, so give

111
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.700
me a break.

112
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.500
There, there.

113
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.140
There, like this.

114
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.560
There.

115
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.680
Right?

116
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.920
Drink it.

117
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.160
He drank it!

118
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.980
There, there.

119
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.580
Good boy, good boy.

120
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.340
There, there...

121
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.800
Don't panic.

122
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.960
The elephant will be surprised.

123
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.060
It's okay.

124
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.440
It's not scary, not scary.

125
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.960
He's become quite a hunter.

126
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.740
He's the same wild animal.

127
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.000
Although he's big, he's still a

128
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.220
child.

129
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.740
He'll be a good boy if he

130
00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.840
doesn't get excited.

131
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.920
But where did this elephant come from?

132
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.860
I don't think anyone bought it as

133
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.960
a pet.

134
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.800
And I don't think it swam

135
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.340
all the way from Africa to the sea.

136
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.940
If that's the case, it's probably

137
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.560
in the zoo.

138
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.180
I see.

139
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.880
Then, please stay here until we pick you

140
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.980
up.

141
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.900
We're going home, Nakagawa.

142
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.660
Please give us a moment, officer.

143
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.300
Takagawa!

144
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.080
I can't get away from him.

145
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.180
He's a wild man.

146
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.040
He's the best couple.

147
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.720
Why is there an elephant?

148
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.680
He's lost.

149
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.540
So, Ryo-chan picked him up.

150
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.620
Why is he in the exit?

151
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.060
If he gets drunk, he'll be in

152
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.160
trouble.

153
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.240
We can't just leave him here until

154
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.340
morning.

155
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.940
Ryo-chan was nice to him,

156
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.360
and he seems to have gotten used to

157
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.460
it.

158
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.620
Elephants get angry at everything but humans.

159
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.220
See?

160
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.620
Wow!

161
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.580
It's a real one!

162
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.320
It's huge!

163
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.900
If you give me 100 yen, I'll

164
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.120
let you ride it.

165
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.640
Wow!

166
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.200
Really?

167
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.760
Ryo-chan!

168
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.880
I'm just kidding.

169
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.580
It's free.

170
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.760
Try riding it.

171
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.160
Okay.

172
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.080
Let me ride it.

173
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.480
It can't be helped.

174
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.600
Here we go.

175
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.540
Wow!

176
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.940
It's amazing!

177
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.200
It's so high.

178
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.400
Brother, it's gone!

179
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.840
It's true!

180
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.060
You haven't gotten your wish yet?

181
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.300
I've reported it to the chief, but

182
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.560
I haven't gotten anything yet.

183
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.920
Okay, Ryo-chan.

184
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.380
If you're having a hard time, I

185
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.820
'll get you some milk.

186
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.520
Are you going home, Senpai?

187
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.160
Ryo-chan!

188
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.100
What?

189
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.680
Why are you all looking at me like

190
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.780
that?

191
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.560
My work hours are over.

192
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.220
You can't drink until tomorrow, right?

193
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.240
You'll be drunk all day anyway.

194
00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.340
I'm not drunk!

195
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.900
Why don't you take care of this

196
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.000
kid until he comes home by himself?

197
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.080
No...

198
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.400
What?

199
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.840
It says it's your schedule for tomorrow.

200
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.580
It's already in minutes.

201
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.660
I have a lot of plans.

202
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.000
9 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 9 o'

203
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.300
clock, 9 o'clock...

204
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.320
10 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 10 o'

205
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.740
clock...

206
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.100
10 o'clock, 45 minutes, morning service, 10

207
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.860
o'clock, 30 minutes...

208
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.740
It's late, so you should go home.

209
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.680
12 o'clock, lunch time...

210
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.500
That's it.

211
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.060
He's always up to something stupid.

212
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.500
You're being irresponsible.

213
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.640
If you brought him here, you should have

214
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.940
taken care of him.

215
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.460
That's right, Ryo-chan.

216
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.960
He's not my elephant.

217
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.380
I didn't bring him here.

218
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.440
He just followed me.

219
00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.679
I can't let my precious vacation be

220
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.100
ruined by something like this.

221
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.640
Good work.

222
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.440
See you.

223
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.720
Oh!

224
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.380
I'm definitely going home.

225
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.580
No matter what you say, I'm going

226
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:05.680
home.

227
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.320
Let me go.

228
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.340
Let me go.

229
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.340
He's not leaving his senpai.

230
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.580
I'll take you with me, Ryo

231
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.000
-chan.

232
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.940
Don't be stupid.

233
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.920
Do it, Ryo-tsu.

234
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.400
This is the director's order.

235
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.180
What?

236
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.660
W-What is it, Ryo-

237
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:26.820
san?

238
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.960
What's with the big one?

239
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.240
It's the director's order.

240
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.960
If you have a problem, go to the

241
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.620
director.

242
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.500
I just cleaned the floor.

243
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.980
Don't walk on your dirty feet.

244
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.220
It's fine, isn't it?

245
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.420
I'm sorry.

246
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.640
What are you doing, Ryo-san?

247
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.840
Don't put an elephant in the bath.

248
00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.720
It's the director's order.

249
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.840
If you have a problem, go to the

250
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.060
director.

251
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.060
Now, the other side.

252
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.300
Now, the back.

253
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.700
All right, it's clean now.

254
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.260
All right, you stay here and wait.

255
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.120
For some reason, he only understands what I

256
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.440
say.

257
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.620
I don't understand anymore, Ryo-

258
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:36.720
san.

259
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.580
I'm begging you, don't sleep on

260
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:46.680
me.

261
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.070
Ryo-san!

262
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.470
What's wrong?

263
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:04.610
That...

264
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.470
You scoundrel!

265
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.130
This is my food!

266
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.310
What are you going to do with our

267
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.590
breakfast?

268
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.450
This is what happens when Ryo-

269
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.710
san brings in an elephant.

270
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.350
If you're the owner, take responsibility!

271
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.950
I'm telling you, this isn't my

272
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.130
elephant.

273
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.190
Do something, Ryo-san!

274
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.470
Listen, don't say anything, and bring it

275
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.770
to me right now.

276
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.950
I haven't heard from him since he

277
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.110
left.

278
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.510
I haven't heard from him since he

279
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:37.610
left.

280
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.070
Then where did he come from?

281
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.650
Is he a stray elephant?

282
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.910
Then call the insurance company!

283
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.470
Anyway, I'll call you as soon as

284
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.570
I get some information.

285
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:49.530
Until then, please.

286
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:49.810
That's all, right?

287
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.370
Both of you are following my good example!

288
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.890
Look at this!

289
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.230
I'm going straight to the plastic model

290
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.810
shop at 9.

291
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.130
30!

292
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.810
Ryo-san, that guy is married.

293
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.730
What?

294
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.870
His name is Douglas A.

295
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.630
He's very handsome.

296
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.090
This is what I wanted!

297
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.210
It's 8,000 yen.

298
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.350
Ryo-san, I forgot my wallet!

299
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.230
Don't say that again.

300
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.010
It's true!

301
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.010
I'll bring the money next time.

302
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.570
Ryo-san!

303
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.250
He's already here.

304
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.650
The back door is this way.

305
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.770
Ryo-san, you can't follow

306
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:53.870
me.

307
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.210
There are two other people who are asking

308
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.190
for money.

309
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.870
If you want it, bring the money.

310
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.590
I can't do that!

311
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.210
I'll definitely pay you, so don't

312
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:03.430
sell it!

313
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:04.410
Please!

314
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:05.950
No!

315
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.730
I'll catch you!

316
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.300
Are you a cop?

317
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.980
Why do I have to go on a

318
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.580
date with an elephant on my day off?

319
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.520
I don't know you!

320
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.700
I'm thirsty after running.

321
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.260
Damn it!

322
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.660
If I had 10 yen left...

323
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.700
10 yen left...

324
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.980
There's a grain of grapes!

325
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.700
Grains of grapes...

326
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.740
Grains of...

327
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.080
10 yen...

328
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.260
In the case of small change, it's

329
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.220
difficult to identify the person who dropped it.

330
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.420
When I get back, I'll show you.

331
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.300
All right, all right.

332
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.080
Good job.

333
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.980
All right, all right.

334
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.880
All right, all right.

335
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:24.780
Ah!

336
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.500
You broke the juice!

337
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.920
You can't drink juice when you're

338
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.020
thirsty!

339
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.960
Give me back my 100 yen, you

340
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.160
bastard!

341
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.620
Two more?

342
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.340
If you don't want it, give me

343
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.100
something else.

344
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.620
I'll give you 10 yen.

345
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.240
I'm thirsty.

346
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.480
It's a hassle to get my wallet

347
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.260
back.

348
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.040
I can't get my 10 yen back.

349
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.240
Thanks to you, I can eat breakfast.

350
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.180
I've got a lot of work to

351
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:00.300
do.

352
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.900
What are you doing?

353
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.800
You picked it up again?

354
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.140
It's a wallet.

355
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.700
And it's heavy.

356
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.920
Hey, isn't that Taiki?

357
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.880
Oh, that wallet.

358
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.340
I've been looking for it.

359
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.000
Oh, thank you.

360
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:23.860
You saved me.

361
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.100
What proof do you have that this is

362
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.820
your wallet?

363
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.240
I'm not sure, but there's a

364
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.060
picture I took with my grandson in it.

365
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.720
Unfortunately, that's all I can prove.

366
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.700
I'm not very interested in you carrying

367
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:39.800
around Taiki.

368
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:40.860
Thank you.

369
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:41.880
I'll be careful.

370
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.440
But this is a rare pet.

371
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.220
I've heard that in Asia, there aren

372
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.160
't many countries that value elephants as gods.

373
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.760
God?

374
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:53.620
Him?

375
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.440
Oh, I'm sorry to say this, but

376
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.380
this elephant is worth a lot of money.

377
00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.300
What?

378
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.480
This much?

379
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.280
A ten-percent reward is a

380
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:03.580
good deal.

381
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.520
Well, have a nice day.

382
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.620
I-I have 30,000 yen.

383
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.420
It looks like he's following us.

384
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.600
That means we'll be back in the

385
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:14.720
afternoon.

386
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.200
Keep up the good work, God!

387
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.120
How much is the ticket for the elephant?

388
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.740
T-The elephant doesn't have a

389
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:25.940
ticket.

390
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.100
Then it's free, right?

391
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.480
It was free.

392
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.300
What?

393
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.220
Hey!

394
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.660
You're eating too much!

395
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.240
If you don't pass, we'll have

396
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.340
to say goodbye here.

397
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.700
If you don't mind, why don't

398
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:51.960
you try jumping?

399
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.520
Hey, sir!

400
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:07.680
Sir!

401
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.020
Sir!

402
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.720
The train is arriving soon.

403
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.440
Hurry!

404
00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:13.440
The train is coming!

405
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.680
You're the first to get off.

406
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:26.880
You're next.

407
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.800
I'm sorry, but could you pull over?

408
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.970
Hey!

409
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.350
He's not coming at all!

410
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.390
What do you mean, God?

411
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.010
That old man is talking nonsense!

412
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.930
The last 1,000 yen.

413
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.530
If we miss this, we'll have to

414
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:11.990
walk back to Kameyari.

415
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.130
If we make four of these, it'll

416
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:18.870
be 40 times.

417
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.030
But there's also the 3-6

418
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.590
line.

419
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.870
The person in the back is waiting.

420
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.030
Please line up after you've decided.

421
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.710
The 6th race will be starting soon.

422
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.890
Okay, this is the 2nd line.

423
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:37.350
We'll be aiming for the 2nd

424
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.010
line and hope for the next race.

425
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.350
It's the 2nd line.

426
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.890
It's the 1st line.

427
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.330
No, it's not the 1st line!

428
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.330
It's the 2nd line!

429
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.130
Okay, next.

430
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.590
No, it's not that!

431
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.330
37, 38, 100 yen.

432
00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.530
Did you make a mistake?

433
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.510
Yamagomori?

434
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.830
I've never heard of it.

435
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:03.970
What?

436
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.990
Both of them are the savi

437
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.130
ors of Mojibushi!

438
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.810
How dare you let this old man die!

439
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.590
You, Yakubyogami!

440
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.830
You bastard!

441
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.830
It can't be...

442
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.070
I won!

443
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.250
I won 100,000 yen!

444
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.890
I won!

445
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.210
You will become money!

446
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.030
Here you go, Yosan.

447
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.810
Here, a new car.

448
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.250
I'm sorry.

449
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.770
You were a great elephant.

450
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.970
Alright, I'll treat you to anything you

451
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:26.070
want.

452
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.670
Where did Ryo-chan go with

453
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.110
the elephant?

454
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.510
Yes.

455
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.670
This is Kameari Park.

456
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.190
Did you see the elephant?

457
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.050
Yes, I saw it.

458
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.220
I feel like we'll be good friends

459
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:50.780
for a long time.

460
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.800
It's cold!

461
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.260
You did it!

462
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:11.720
You have a cute face.

463
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.190
Tonto!

464
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.350
Tonto?

465
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.330
Ryo-chan!

466
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:33.850
Bujo!

467
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:34.730
What are you going to do with the

468
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.830
elephant?

469
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.790
I got a call from the zoo that

470
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.310
they were looking for an elephant.

471
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.570
But Ryo-chan is missing.

472
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.310
I'm glad both the elephant and you

473
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.950
are safe.

474
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.410
Sorry for the trouble.

475
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.850
I heard that Tonto's mother died

476
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.290
yesterday.

477
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.070
What?

478
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.190
We, the zookeepers, were busy taking care

479
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.070
of his mother.

480
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.030
We completely forgot about Tonto.

481
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.250
He was alone and lonely, so he left

482
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.350
the cage.

483
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.710
Tonto has helped us a lot.

484
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.350
What are you talking about?

485
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.170
Hey!

486
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.790
What are you going to do with my

487
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.050
elephant?

488
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.470
Ryo-chan!

489
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:23.450
What are you doing?

490
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.610
Bujo!

491
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:30.930
He doesn't like it, does he?

492
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.350
I'm going to buy it!

493
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.250
Nakagawa!

494
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.070
Come here!

495
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.330
Let me go!

496
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.410
Don't let Nakagawa go!

497
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.890
You're in danger!

498
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.670
Please help us!

499
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.230
Let's go!

500
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.730
Let me go!

501
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:08.690
Tonto is my elephant!

502
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.650
Ryo-chan's kindness...

503
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.510
I won't forget it even if I

504
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.610
go back to the zoo.

505
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.750
Tonto!

506
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.790
Wait for me, Tonto!

507
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.550
Wait for me!

508
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.070
Tonto!

509
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.810
Senpai...

510
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.690
Ryo-chan...

511
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.970
He may look like that, but he's

512
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:33.430
so kind.

513
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.770
Tonto!

514
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.410
Tell me!

515
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:38.630
Tell me!

516
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.030
What's the next show?

517
00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.830
I want him to win at the zoo

518
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.450
with me.

519
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.070
Tonto!

520
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.310
If there's no next show, what's

521
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.210
the next derby?

522
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:06.280
Did you fall in love with Megumi?

523
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.900
Good job, Honda!

524
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.740
Be sure to get it on the 102

525
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.300
nd show!

526
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.980
I'm a nice little guy with a

527
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.080
lot of experience.

528
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.720
I'll teach you the points of the

529
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:15.820
gate!

530
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.540
Next time, on HONDA, For Love

531
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.660
's Sake, Thanks for watching!

532
00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:36.020

pass Don't look at me like that

534
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.720

The sun is calling us outside the door
