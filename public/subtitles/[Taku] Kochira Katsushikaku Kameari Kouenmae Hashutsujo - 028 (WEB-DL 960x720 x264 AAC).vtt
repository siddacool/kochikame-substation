27
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.310

I knew it!

40
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.670

Ah, good weather Ryo-tsu,

76
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.860

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.700
that the boss isn't yelling He's

78
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.480
going through the usual level of anger Look

80
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.520

83
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.820
He's just peeling off the sticker on

84
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.920
the present What's this?

85
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.640
It's not just that He came to

86
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.980
the ice cream shop What is he doing?

87
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.120
Ah, he's pulling out the ice cream

88
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.840
stick and checking if it's a hit

89
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.720
There's more He's buying bread I

90
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.600
wonder what he's looking for I know!

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.370
the people at the store are bothering him

96
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.270
That's impossible It's not just that

97
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.350
You're in the security camera at the

98
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.390
pachinko shop, the game center,

99
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.970

Ryo-san, do you think you

140
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:49.680

147
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.240
