00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.140
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Summer has come again this year.

2
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.060
Summer has come again this year.

3
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.840
A big wave is coming.

4
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.580
A big chest is coming.

5
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.900
Summer has come again this year.

6
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.560
Summer has come again this year.

7
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.500
A big wave is coming.

8
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.220
A big chest is coming.

9
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.500
A big butt is coming.

10
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:38.610
Takatan Azumo Go, Takanoy

11
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.010
ama.

12
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.430
Go, Takanoyama.

13
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.230
Go, go, go!

14
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.290
Go to the left!

15
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.810
Takanoyama!

16
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.350
He did it!

17
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.830
He did it!

18
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.790
Takanoyama.

19
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.790
He was the most powerful.

20
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.950
Takanoyama is the president of

21
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.050
Konbashi without a doubt.

22
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.030
I don't want to miss the chance

23
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.270
to see the most powerful Takanoy

24
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.449
ama.

25
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.850
I saw him on TV.

26
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.630
You don't know the real fun of

27
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.610
sumo wrestling, do you?

28
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.050
Have you ever seen a real sumo

29
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.150
wrestler?

30
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.030
Sometimes I see a real sumo wrestler

31
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.190
walking in a yukata.

32
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.830
I've seen a real sumo wrestler

33
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.990
in a yukata.

34
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.630
Why don't you see a real sum

35
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.870
o wrestler in a yukata?

36
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.810
Sumo wrestling tickets are

37
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.590
not so easy to get.

38
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.630
Is that so?

39
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.950
I didn't know that.

40
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.470
If you want to see a real sum

41
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.850
o wrestler in a yukata, you

42
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.650
have to have a lot of experience.

43
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.030
It's my lifelong dream to see a

44
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.130
real sumo wrestler in a yuk

45
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.230
ata.

46
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.530
A real sumo wrestler is your lifelong

47
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.670
dream, isn't it?

48
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.370
Oh, I think I saw a real sum

49
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.590
o wrestler in a yukata.

50
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.990
Hey, where are you going?

51
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.070
I'm going on a patrol.

52
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.590
What?

53
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.930
It's rare for Ryo-chan

54
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.430
to leave soup.

55
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.310
It's a big summer sale in the

56
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.410
Kamiwari shopping district.

57
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.090
Sumo wrestling tickets are

58
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.190
on sale.

59
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.750
It's the end of last week.

60
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.050
It hasn't come out yet.

61
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.930
This is bad.

62
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.170
Ryo-san is trying to take

63
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.330
revenge.

64
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.690
Oh, no.

65
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.010
It's over for today.

66
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.350
It's too much.

67
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.010
What did Ryo-san do?

68
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.850
Don't you know?

69
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.610
He is a very lucky person.

70
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.070
Two years ago, he went to Hokka

71
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.250
ido.

72
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.510
Last year, he went to Guam for

73
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.970
four days.

74
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.970
He won a computer.

75
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.470
Hey!

76
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.870
Hey!

77
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.110
Why are you in a hurry?

78
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.890
Take this.

79
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.790
All right, let's go.

80
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.450
Dirty, golden, black soap.

81
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.790
Dirty, golden, black soap.

82
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.370
It's not coming out.

83
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.780
It's coming out again.

84
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.880
I did it.

85
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.160
Senpai, did you come back already?

86
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.280
Yes.

87
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.840
I was just walking around.

88
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.420
Is it okay to say that?

89
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.740
Oh, no.

90
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.820
I dropped the tickets for sumo wrestling.

91
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.180
What?

92
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.440
What happened?

93
00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.880
What's that?

94
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.180
I have a big face, too.

95
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.760
Ryo-tsu, you are amazing.

96
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.800
No, I'm not.

97
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.780
Well, that's...

98
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.600
Come on.

99
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.180
Who wants to buy this ticket?

100
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.280
Sumo is a Japanese martial art.

101
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.400
Flowers are cherry blossoms, mountains are Mt.

102
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.500
Fuji.

103
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.320
If you don't watch sumo, you

104
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.700
can't be a Japanese.

105
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.420
You can't be a Japanese.

106
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.300
Hey, you!

107
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.380
Don't you forget the spirit of Japan?

108
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.080
Anyway, this is a ticket to the village.

109
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.940
You can't buy it with a salary

110
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.580
of a salaryman.

111
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.000
Is he here?

112
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.120
He's not here.

113
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.640
Let's go inside.

114
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Let's go together.

115
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.620
Yes.

116
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.760
There's only one person left.

117
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.960
Oh, I forgot an important person.

118
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.820
Oh, no.

119
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.820
I have to invite a ramen shop owner.

120
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.420
Senpai, that's too much.

121
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.860
That's right.

122
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.980
I'm kidding.

123
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.980
I have to invite a manager who takes

124
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.080
care of me every day.

125
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.200
Manager, you're going, too, right?

126
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200
Of course.

127
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.260
I'd love to invite you.

128
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.860
By the way, did you have a high

129
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.540
-class brandy?

130
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.560
You were proud of it.

131
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.240
No, I didn't.

132
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.620
The brandy you drink straight is delicious.

133
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.780
You can bring it to me.

134
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.740
All right, that's it.

135
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.160
Oh, no.

136
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.140
It's a lot of money.

137
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.700
I can't help it.

138
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.200
I'm excited.

139
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.080
He's a great person.

140
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.360
That's right.

141
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.660
He has a big national flag.

142
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.420
That's a Japanese national flag.

143
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

144
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

145
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.680
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.880
She's so beautiful.

147
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.060
A lot of foreigners are coming to see

148
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.160
you.

149
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.500
The popularity of Osmo is quite international.

150
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.180
The popularity of Osmo is quite international.

151
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.540
It's a great honor to be able

152
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.320
to see it in person.

153
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.880
By the way, who did you get it

154
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:46.980
from?

155
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.720
By the way, the other day, someone gave

156
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.440
me a ticket to see

157
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.540
it in person.

158
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.740
Giku.

159
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.640
That's right.

160
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.960
It was a uniform police officer.

161
00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.140
What?

162
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.900
So what?

163
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.340
What's wrong with that?

164
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.480
If you don't like the tic

165
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.240
ket, you can go home.

166
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.800
No, no.

167
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.540
It doesn't matter what the uniform

168
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:09.880
is.

169
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.140
It doesn't change the fact that we

170
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.760
can see Osmo.

171
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.900
That's great.

172
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.520
I really appreciate your hospitality.

173
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.180
Then let's go.

174
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.320
You all have tickets, right?

175
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.600
Yes.

176
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.400
All right.

177
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.680
Don't be late for me.

178
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.880
My ticket.

179
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.900
Hey!

180
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.440
Wait!

181
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.080
You idiot!

182
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.600
Ha-ha-ha!

183
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.419
Ryo-goku's wind is

184
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:39.940
doing a good thing.

185
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.260
Now, the three of us can watch it

186
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:43.360
slowly.

187
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.240
Leave that guy alone.

188
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.360
Let's go.

189
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:46.740
Let's go.

190
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.260
Yes, sir.

191
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.140
Huh?

192
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.580
Hey, look at that!

193
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:51.460
What?

194
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.480
Yay!

195
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.240
Sumida River's flow was so strong

196
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:55.760
that I was saved.

197
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.940
Did you jump into the Sumida River?

198
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.780
Of course I did!

199
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.620
I can't afford to lose that precious

200
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:00.960
ticket.

201
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.780
Man, he's unbelievable.

202
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.210
Oh, he's doing it!

203
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:29.710
He's doing it!

204
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.970
Yeah, a live show is great.

205
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.010
A live show.

206
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.750
Here it is.

207
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.510
Wow, it's pretty small.

208
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.690
Well, it's close to the surface, so

209
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.130
it's fine.

210
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:42.750
Huh?

211
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:43.410
What's that?

212
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.770
It's a snack and a drink.

213
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.590
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.

214
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.990
As expected of Masseki.

215
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.290
I heard you can get souvenirs on

216
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.390
your way home.

217
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.270
There's also a brandy from the

218
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:53.370
president.

219
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.330
This is going to be a great party.

220
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.270
I didn't come here to have a

221
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.370
party.

222
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.130
I came here to watch a live show.

223
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.130
Wow, that's a great binoculars.

224
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.790
It's a must-have.

225
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.010
Hey, boss, you're smart.

226
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.870
Let me see it.

227
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.270
Let me see it.

228
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.470
Wait, wait, I'll go first.

229
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:11.190
Huh?

230
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.090
Who gave you this great seat?

231
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.030
That again?

232
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.190
All right, all right, I'll show you.

233
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.510
Thank you, thank you.

234
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.930
Oh, oh, oh.

235
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.490
I guess second-floor seats aren

236
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.150
't good for you.

237
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.150
Yeah.

238
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.230
Oh, it's the blonde cutie from

239
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.330
earlier.

240
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.030
If you don't want to see my

241
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.430
pants, give them back to me.

242
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.830
It's fine, it's not like I

243
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.110
'm going to lose weight.

244
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.810
That's not the problem.

245
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.910
Well, well, let's have a toast.

246
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.710
Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot.

247
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.470
Cheers!

248
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.270
Hey, did you forget something?

249
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.530
Huh?

250
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.690
What?

251
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.410
You know, to thank Dr. Ryotsu.

252
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.150
I guess that's what you normally do.

253
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.010
What are you talking about?

254
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.710
Oh, is that so?

255
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.610
Oh, wait, wait.

256
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.630
Hey, this guy's in a bad mood.

257
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.630
I'm going home first, so I'll

258
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:01.810
give you a souvenir.

259
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.610
All right, I'll tell you, I'll

260
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.330
tell you, I'll tell you.

261
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.510
To thank Dr. Ryotsu.

262
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.010
Cheers!

263
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.630
From now on, this is Takanoy

264
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.610
ama, Oh, look, look!

265
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.750
It's Takanoyama, it's

266
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.330
Takanoyama.

267
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.050
When you see it in person, you can

268
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:26.670
see the tension in his body.

269
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.170
I can't wait to see Musumi

270
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:29.290
no.

271
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.690
1.

272
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.310
That's right.

273
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.170
What kind of big move will the two

274
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.850
of them show us?

275
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.810
I'm looking forward to it.

276
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.350
I see.

277
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.530
So this is Makunouchi B

278
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.730
ento.

279
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.390
Why don't you calm down a little

280
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:42.930
and look at the sumo?

281
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.670
I skipped lunch.

282
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.130
Can I have some sushi for Reiko?

283
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.070
Can I have some sushi for Reiko?

284
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.010
Yes, you can.

285
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:51.870
Sorry.

286
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.590
Senpai, he's eating silently.

287
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:56.870
It's okay, it's okay.

288
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.810
It's better to give him food and

289
00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.650
leave him alone.

290
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.130
East.

291
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.450
Mayu no Umi.

292
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.470
Mayu no Umi.

293
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.480
Mayu no Umi is a two

294
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.960
-digit number, so he's really

295
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.460
fired up.

296
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.280
Unlike on TV, I can feel his spirit.

297
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:19.980
Go for it!

298
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.180
That's it!

299
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:22.880
Push!

300
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.520
Hey, Mucho.

301
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.760
Can you take this?

302
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.860
Shut up!

303
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.040
Can you eat this piece of yak

304
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.300
itori?

305
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.280
Don't call me that.

306
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.920
Oh, no!

307
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.880
It's over!

308
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.600
Mayu no Umi!

309
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.600
It's an amigasou!

310
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:44.820
Amigasou!

311
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.760
I've never seen that before!

312
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.060
You idiot!

313
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.300
You didn't see the match!

314
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.280
But if I ate it, you'd get

315
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:52.540
mad!

316
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.780
I wouldn't get mad over something like

317
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:54.880
that!

318
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.760
You're such a...

319
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.880
You're so meticulous!

320
00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.920
What did you say?!

321
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.320
That's enough!

322
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.820
I'm going to the bathroom!

323
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.640
What a guy!

324
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.140
He's such a jerk!

325
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.760
He just missed the first ball, and now

326
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.160
he's making a scene.

327
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.900
That's true.

328
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.020
The manager was looking forward to the first

329
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.260
ball.

330
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.560
Why don't you watch it on TV

331
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:19.960
when you get home?

332
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.280
Then you wouldn't know why I came

333
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.400
here.

334
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.740
Hey, who did you come here for?

335
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.560
Oh, there you go again.

336
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.460
You're the one who hit Fukub

337
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.120
iki, aren't you?

338
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.780
You're late, Manager.

339
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.680
Are you lost somewhere?

340
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.560
In the end, I'm the one who

341
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:39.860
has to take care of things.

342
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.660
Huh?

343
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.260
Who are you?

344
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.840
Oh, sorry.

345
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.860
Are you okay?

346
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.240
There's been a lot of fishing damage

347
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.760
lately, so be careful.

348
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.060
Yes, sir.

349
00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.480
Oh, I'm sorry.

350
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.920
Are you hurt?

351
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.580
I'm fine.

352
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.560
It's nothing.

353
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.840
Is that so?

354
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.840
I'm really sorry.

355
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.560
Huh?

356
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:39.000
That's strange.

357
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.660
I thought it came out of this area.

358
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.480
Oh, I'm in trouble.

359
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:50.580
I'm in trouble.

360
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.640
No matter where I look from the entrance,

361
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.780
it looks the same.

362
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.620
Is something wrong?

363
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.060
Oh, no.

364
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.500
I don't know where I'm supposed

365
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:00.600
to be.

366
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.120
Manager!

367
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:03.260
Huh?

368
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:03.920
Over here!

369
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.020
Oh, Ryuzu!

370
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.520
Oh, I just got here.

371
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.380
Is that so?

372
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.980
There's been a lot of fishing damage

373
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.760
in the ship today, so be careful.

374
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.760
Oh, thank you.

375
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.440
Thank you for your hard work.

376
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.620
No, I was just about to get lost.

377
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.660
Come on, let's go back.

378
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.020
Hey, Ryuzu.

379
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:26.900
Ryuzu.

380
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.580
I'm right in front of the store.

381
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.460
Let's go buy some souvenirs for

382
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:30.560
today's practice.

383
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.800
Oh, hurry up.

384
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.280
We're already in the second half of

385
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:35.380
the game.

386
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.120
Yeah, what should I buy?

387
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.260
Oh, I have an idea.

388
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.180
Takanoyama's is really big.

389
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.960
Yeah, this isn't bad.

390
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.580
If it's a high-end product,

391
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.460
it'll sell a lot to the women

392
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:53.660
in the office.

393
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.960
Oh, this military badge is pretty good.

394
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.480
I'll buy one as a souvenir.

395
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.220
Oh, sorry.

396
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.420
How much is this?

397
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.000
Huh?

398
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.280
What is it, Chief?

399
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.100
Is something wrong?

400
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.860
I don't have a wallet.

401
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.600
That's strange.

402
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:11.980
I'm sure...

403
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.880
I don't like this.

404
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.740
Didn't you leave it at home and

405
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.200
forget it?

406
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.320
No way.

407
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.980
I bought a ticket and got on the

408
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.580
train.

409
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.240
Oh, well.

410
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.260
I'll lend it to you.

411
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.540
But I won't take any interest.

412
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:26.960
Huh?

413
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.220
What is it?

414
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.880
This isn't my wallet.

415
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.500
Oh!

416
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.840
That's my...

417
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.960
That's my wallet.

418
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.240
Huh?

419
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.420
Wait a minute.

420
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.580
Huh?

421
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.900
It's a woman's wallet.

422
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:40.840
It's Suri!

423
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.400
Suri, someone come!

424
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:42.960
What?

425
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:43.940
Idiot!

426
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.020
No, no!

427
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.180
Where's Suri?

428
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.880
It's her!

429
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.920
It's her, Suri!

430
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:49.760
Huh?

431
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.480
I said no!

432
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.620
Come on!

433
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.040
Chief!

434
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:53.680
Let's run!

435
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.180
Wait!

436
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.980
You two!

437
00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.680
Stop!

438
00:16:59.280 --> 00:16:59.840
Stop!

439
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.620
B-but...

440
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.180
Why do I have to run, too?

441
00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:04.480
Ryozu!

442
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.599
What's going on?

443
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.760
What the hell is this?

444
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.300
I don't know, either.

445
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.510
I know!

446
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.270
It's that time!

447
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.810
That woman!

448
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.369
She's blaming Suri for everything!

449
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.089
Damn it!

450
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:21.930
Where is she?

451
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.690
She should be around here somewhere.

452
00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:24.730
Ryozu!

453
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.670
Explain yourself!

454
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:26.270
Ryozu!

455
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.710
Wait!

456
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.050
No!

457
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.850
At this rate, we'll both get caught!

458
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.750
Chief!

459
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.210
For the sake of justice, please sacrifice yourself

460
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.310
a little!

461
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.710
What?

462
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.170
What did you say?

463
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.410
Ah!

464
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.310
It's a flying saucer!

465
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:40.530
Where?

466
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.190
Where?

467
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.670
I'm sorry!

468
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.670
Oh!

469
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:45.450
Wait!

470
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.900
They're both so slow.

471
00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.440
I wonder what they're doing.

472
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.160
I hope they're not getting lost together.

473
00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.100
If it's those two, it's possible,

474
00:17:59.260 --> 00:17:59.600
so I'm scared.

475
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.080
Should I go look for them?

476
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.720
No, it's fine.

477
00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.040
I'll be back soon.

478
00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.840
Anyway, it's only now that we can

479
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.320
eat our lunch.

480
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.860
That's right.

481
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:11.920
Hey!

482
00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.420
Oh, Ryo-chan!

483
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.380
Senpai, what are you doing?

484
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.920
Move, move, move, move!

485
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.700
A typhoon!

486
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:22.840
How rude!

487
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.840
Let's go!

488
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.320
Yes, sir!

489
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.220
This is Three, right?

490
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:31.500
No!

491
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.600
That's not it!

492
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.400
But you're his friend, right?

493
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.540
That's why I'm...

494
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.240
Ugh!

495
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.520
You don't understand!

496
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.180
Where is he?

497
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.760
Where is that blond guy?

498
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.640
I sacrificed the chief.

499
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.020
No matter where he is, I'm going

500
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.060
to catch him!

501
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.660
There he is!

502
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.280
Oh!

503
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.040
Sorry!

504
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.260
Are you okay?

505
00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:58.400
Huh?

506
00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.140
Yes.

507
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.620
It's Three!

508
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.020
That's Three!

509
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.600
Oh, my God!

510
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.200
Oh!

511
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.720
We're under arrest!

512
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.300
We're under arrest!

513
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.420
Wait!

514
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.580
Senpai!

515
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:11.760
Help!

516
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.940
Wait for me!

517
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.960
Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

518
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.100
I got you, Three!

519
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:22.820
Damn it!

520
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.340
I can't let you get away!

521
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.860
Oh, no!

522
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.440
You bastard!

523
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.640
Get your dirty hands off me!

524
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.480
Shut up!

525
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.780
You were arrested by me, Three's right

526
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.020
-hand man!

527
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.040
You're under arrest!

528
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.980
What are you talking about?

529
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.620
You're Three's right-hand man!

530
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.280
Let go of that girl!

531
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.920
Hey, let go of me!

532
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.600
Three is this blonde girl!

533
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.800
What?

534
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.080
There's no way she's Three!

535
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.260
You're worse than her!

536
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.340
Don't judge me by my face!

537
00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.500
She's not Three!

538
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.140
She was trying to save me!

539
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:01.740
What?

540
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.240
Three is that girl!

541
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.240
That's right!

542
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.160
But...

543
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.620
What?

544
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.020
Where's the evidence?

545
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.540
Damn it!

546
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.780
Wait a minute.

547
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.120
What are you doing?

548
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.360
What are you doing?

549
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.000
See?

550
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.520
That's what I'm talking about!

551
00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.190
Ryo!

552
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.670
Ryo!

553
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.030
You!

554
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:25.790
You!

555
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:26.730
You abandoned me!

556
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.650
Well, well, well.

557
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.850
For the sake of justice, you have to

558
00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.650
make some sacrifices, don't you?

559
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.790
Besides, if you ran that much, you wouldn

560
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.390
't be able to exercise, would you?

561
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.130
What?

562
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.470
No way.

563
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.230
What?

564
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.750
Why did you put so many of them

565
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.570
in my jacket?

566
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.050
You have a cute face, and you're

567
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:50.150
good at this.

568
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.030
Th-That's my wallet!

569
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.650
I wasn't careless!

570
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.470
Even if you told me to...

571
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.640
B...

572
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.020
B...

573
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.100
You always cause me so much trouble.

574
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.840
How could you say that, Chief?

575
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.700
Well, I might be the type of guy

576
00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.580
but at least I'm not the type

577
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:25.860
of guy who loses his wallet.

578
00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.120
How could you say that?

579
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.040
You put so many of your wallets

580
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.520
in my pocket, and I didn't even

581
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:32.620
notice!

582
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.380
What did you say?

583
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.240
Ow!

584
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:38.680
Ow!

585
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.260
My pants are going to break!

586
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.200
Chief, hurry up!

587
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.380
All that's left is Musubi

588
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:43.500
No.

589
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:43.840
1.

590
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.360
It's the final match between Yokos

591
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:47.460
una.

592
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.320
This is bad.

593
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.500
At least we have to watch it.

594
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.260
Ryotsu, we'll talk later.

595
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.500
Hurry up!

596
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.620
We have to focus on the main event.

597
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.180
We have to watch it no matter what!

598
00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.800
He totally forgot with my ticket!

599
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.600
He totally forgot with my ticket!

600
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.260
Well, I guess it was worth it.

601
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.020
If I could watch this match, it was

602
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.840
worth coming all the way here.

603
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.760
Go!

604
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.200
Go!

605
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:20.860
There!

606
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.840
What?

607
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.140
I can't see anything.

608
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:25.900
Chief!

609
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:26.960
Here!

610
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.040
I can't see anything!

611
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.820
Let go!

612
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.980
I can't believe that No.

613
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.120
1...

614
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.020
What?

615
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.120
What's going on?

616
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.960
It's over.

617
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.760
It's over.

618
00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.980
I'll never be able to see with

619
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.080
my eyes again.

620
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:42.980
It was a great match.

621
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.620
What a waste.

622
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.760
In this match, the winner is Takah

623
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.360
iko Takahiko Takanoyama

624
00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.580
Takanoyama You're so annoying.

625
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.120
What's your grudge against me?

626
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.560
You just came here, but you're always

627
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.660
talking about trivial things.

628
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.120
What did you say?

629
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.080
No.

630
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.040
1 You bastard!

631
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.140
You bastard!

632
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:15.900
What did you say?

633
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.540
You're fired!

634
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.740
I'll fire you!

635
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.200
That's too much, That's too much,

636
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.140
Chief!

637
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.180
Shut up!

638
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:23.680
Shut up!

639
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.200
What did you say?

640
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.960
What did you say?

641
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.240
Hey, what are you doing?

642
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.640
Oh, the big game has begun here, too.

643
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.640
Go, go, go!

644
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.040
Go, go, go!

645
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.420
Hey, what are you doing?

646
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.820
It can't be helped.

647
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.700
I have to leave them alone until the

648
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:42.800
game is over.

649
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.620
But...

650
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.260
I shouldn't have come this time.

651
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760
Red, stop!

652
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.540
Blue, advance!

653
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.920
Blue, advance!

654
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:09.780
What?

655
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.980
Is that common sense?

656
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.460
Are you guys keeping that common sense?

657
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:14.960
All right!

658
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.540
I'll guide you to safety!

659
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.900
