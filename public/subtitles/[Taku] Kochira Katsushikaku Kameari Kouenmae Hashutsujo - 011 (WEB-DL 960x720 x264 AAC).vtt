2
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.090
The summer has come.

3
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.980
This year, too, the summer has come.

4
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.800
A big wave is coming.

5
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.380
I want to drink.

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.360
I'm going to drink.

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.159
The south wind is blowing.

8
00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.840
A big chest is coming.

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.860
This year, too, the summer has come.

10
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.780
This year, too, the summer has come.

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.480
A big wave is coming.

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.920
I want to drink.

13
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.020
I'm going to drink.

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.120
The south wind is blowing.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.420
A big butt is coming.

16
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.800
I want to drink.

17
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.160
I'm going to drink.

18
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm going to drink.

19
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.460
The south wind is blowing.

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:19.600

agawa Prefecture's Otaku View

23
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.800
Everyone, I'd like to order lunch.

24
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.360
What would you like?

25
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.100
I'd like chashu noodles and

26
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.560
gyoza.

27
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.580
I'd like stir-fried ribs.

28
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.720
I'd like fried rice.

29
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.020
What about you, Ryo-chan?

30
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.820
Oh, it's before payday, so I

31
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.700
'll have ramen and rice.

32
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.780
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

33
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.660
Are you on a diet?

34
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.540
No way.

35
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.260
There's no way Ryo-chan

36
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.440
is on a diet.

37
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.340
There's no way I'm on a

38
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.440
diet.

39
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.880
I'm working out hard like this to

40
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.500
make myself hungry.

41
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.400
Oh, so you're not hungry?

42
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.540
That's not it.

43
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.200
There's a party at Nakagawa

44
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.020
's house today.

45
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240
Oh, is there?

46
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.020
Nakagawa, there's going to be

47
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.200
a great meal at tonight's party, right?

48
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.820
Yes.

49
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.100
Iron-man-class chefs and cooks

50
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.700
are going to cook with all their might.

51
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.780
You don't get to eat that kind

52
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.100
of food very often.

53
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.040
Is that why you're so hungry?

54
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.580
Hey, you.

55
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.660
I'm not bragging, but I haven

56
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.580
't eaten anything since yesterday.

57
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.700
You idiot.

58
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.660
You can't work when you're hungry.

59
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.120
What's wrong with you?

60
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.000
Why don't you eat lunch?

61
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.780
I'm sorry to say this, but you

62
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.680
don't have the right to order your

63
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.160
subordinates to eat.

64
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.460
Anyway, can I eat gyoza and

65
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.080
chashu noodles?

66
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.800
I won't be able to eat at

67
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.260
the party.

68
00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.960
That's right.

69
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.700
Reiko, I don't want gyo

70
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.800
za.

71
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.260
Just give me chashu noodles.

72
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.100
Yes, sir.

73
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.820
I don't want anything else.

74
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.980
I'll have ramen.

75
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.800
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.710
Nakagawa.

77
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.090
What kind of party is Party Party?

78
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.370
It's a birthday party for the prince

79
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.470
of the Kondara Kingdom.

80
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.050
The Kondara Kingdom?

81
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.990
It's a small country, so I don

82
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.790
't think you know.

83
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.150
The king and my father have been friends

84
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.250
for a long time.

85
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.390
When they come to Japan, they always stay

86
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.490
at my house.

87
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.050
This is the first time I've been

88
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.350
on a ferrari this wide.

89
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.090
I asked the president of the ferr

90
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.050
ari to make it a wide body.

91
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.070
But isn't this a violation of the

92
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.250
road?

93
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.570
It's okay.

94
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.150
This is the city road of the Nak

95
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.250
agawa family.

96
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.450
What did you say?

97
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.770
There was an exit called Orita Inter

98
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.310
Nakagawa.

99
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.590
Is it Nakagawa's Nakag

100
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.750
awa?

101
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.610
Yes.

102
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.950
I made it for my house.

103
00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.450
I'm not tired of this.

104
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.930
I'm not tired of this.

105
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.829
I'm so hungry that I'm going

106
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:20.990
to die.

107
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.910
We're almost there.

108
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.890
What?

109
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.310
I can't see my house.

110
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.070
The ferrari is just going on.

111
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.570
The other side of the ferrari

112
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.310
is my house.

113
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.250
What?

114
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.500
How big is your house?

115
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.660
I think it's 100 times bigger than

116
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.760
Disneyland.

117
00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.580
What?

118
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.060
If it's that big, If it's

119
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.980
that big, You have to put a gate

120
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.980
everywhere.

121
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.520
There are 12 gates in total.

122
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520
I'm going to the closest gate called

123
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.320
Mito Koumon.

124
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.760
Mito Koumon?

125
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.960
There are other gates such as Daisen,

126
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.240
Seishunno, Kinokuniya

127
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.320
Bunzaemon, etc.

128
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.140
We're almost there.

129
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.540
We're almost there.

130
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.700
We're here.

131
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.540
We're going to fly.

132
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.620
What?

133
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.990
What's wrong?

134
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.290
I think I got lost.

135
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.990
Don't get lost in your own house.

136
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.950
I'll navigate you right away.

137
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.730
Please confirm your destination.

138
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.290
I can't reach it without a navigation

139
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.750
system in the base.

140
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.410
I can finally see my house.

141
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.390
It's about the same size as the

142
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.230
president's house.

143
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.250
It's a big base, but it's

144
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.610
small.

145
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.970
What?

146
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.510
It's a nice house.

147
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.410
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.690
That's a dog house.

149
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.190
The president has been paying the loan for

150
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.090
20 years in the same house as the

151
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.190
dog owner?

152
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.250
Mr. Ryo.

153
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.290
You laughed too much.

154
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.150
What?

155
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.530
Is this your house?

156
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.410
Yes.

157
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.050
To be precise, it's a room.

158
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.630
My parents live in that house over there.

159
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.430
And over there is my sister's house.

160
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.110
It's a pretty small, common house.

161
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.710
Here you go.

162
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.570
Is this the living room?

163
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.290
That's...

164
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.630
It's an invader game!

165
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.890
And it's black and white!

166
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.110
It's a cellophane wall!

167
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.830
Wow!

168
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.950
There's even a pool!

169
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.090
No, this is a bath.

170
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.350
The pool is over here.

171
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.070
The bath is moving.

172
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.750
No, the whole room is moving.

173
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.330
The whole room?

174
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.530
Wow!

175
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.450
You can't buy a pool in an

176
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:55.550
amusement park.

177
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.890
A golf course...

178
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.730
And an airfield!

179
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.690
Yay!

180
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.190
I got 50,000 points!

181
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.390
Did you see that?

182
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.670
Mr. Ryo's parents' house!

183
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.530
I'll leave him alone.

184
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.830
What's up?

185
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.210
Hey!

186
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:21.450
Bark!

187
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:22.190

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.170
What happened?

193
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.290
May I come in?

194
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.350
Yes, come in.

195
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.310
You look great, Reiko.

196
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.070
Thank you.

197
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.250
I didn't know I had to dress

198
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.690
up like this.

199
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.550
We've invited famous people from all over

200
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.650
the world.

201
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.510
Please bear with us.

202
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.070
But Ryo, you still look great in

203
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.770
a tuxedo.

204
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:20.750
Thank you very much!

205
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.470
What?

206
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.090
An earthquake?

207
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.730
Everyone, calm down!

208
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.170
You're an officer.

209
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.370
No matter what the situation is, you have

210
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.530
to be calm and calm!

211
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:32.730
It's not just a tuxedo!

212
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.210
Senpai, it's not an earthquake.

213
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.330
It's an elevator.

214
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.470
What?

215
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.590
The whole room is an elevator?

216
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.750
So I live in a house smaller than

217
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:46.850
an elevator.

218
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.630
Welcome.

219
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.400
He's amazing.

220
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.800
Look!

221
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.280
Prime Minister Hashimoto is here, too.

222
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.860
And over there, there's a celebrity with

223
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.900
a life-threatening condition, Sara

224
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.380
Takaoka, and the man that President

225
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.400
Ohara likes, Sabu Kitashima.

226
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.980
I'll get his autograph later.

227
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.080
Anyway, let's eat!

228
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.500
Senpai, wait!

229
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.820
What is it?

230
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.720
I'll introduce you to Prince Hondara.

231
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.940
Hey, Prince Hondara!

232
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.720
Oh, Keiichi!

233
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.520
Happy birthday!

234
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.140
Thank you!

235
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.100
I thought you were a cooler guy, but

236
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.060
you're just a fat kid.

237
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.200
Ryo-chan!

238
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.060
What?

239
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.180
Well, Prince, let me introduce you to my

240
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:57.860
colleagues.

241
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.740
This is President Ohara, my boss.

242
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.880
Nice to meet you.

243
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.320
Nice to meet you.

244
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.340
And this is my senpai, Ryo

245
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:06.440
ji.

246
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.120
Hello, hello.

247
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.400
It's your time.

248
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.600
10 plus 10 is 20.

249
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.960
20 plus 20 is 40.

250
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.740
What are you talking about?

251
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.960
Prince, your Japanese is terrible.

252
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.660
You idiot!

253
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.780
Why didn't you tell me that before?

254
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.780
I'm going to be the man who

255
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.800
leads Japan's future!

256
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.840
I'm going to be the man who

257
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.040
leads Japan's future!

258
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.500
I'm Ryoji Kankichi!

259
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.340
This gorilla is so funny.

260
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.600
He called me a pig.

261
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.920
I'm not a pig!

262
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.440
Well, well.

263
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.340
It's your birthday party.

264
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840
Let's get along.

265
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.840
I don't care if you don't

266
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:48.940
greet me.

267
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.900
I'm going.

268
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.790
Prince, don't worry about him.

269
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.330
He's just an idiot.

270
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.590
You stupid gorilla!

271
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:12.270
Mr. Yoita, I'd like 10 pieces

272
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:12.850
of toro and sea urchin.

273
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.550
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.270
The prince told me not to eat anything

275
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.610
until he turns off the candles.

276
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.530
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday!

277
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:23.910
I'm begging you!

278
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:24.950
I don't care!

279
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.150
Prince!

280
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.870
I forgive you!

281
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.690
I don't care!

282
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.270
You're a good guy.

283
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.870
What's wrong?

284
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.990
Keiichi's senior told

285
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.370
me to hold a specially delicious s

286
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.230
ushi for him.

287
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.890
You'll be a good king!

288
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.250
Hurry up and hold it!

289
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.150
Yes, sir!

290
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.510
Yes, sir!

291
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.410
It looks delicious.

292
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.050
It's good!

293
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.330
It's good!

294
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.020
You said bad things about me!

295
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.880
Prince, please turn off the candles.

296
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.300
Prince, please come to the stage.

297
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.040
Yes, sir!

298
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.900
I'll never forget this.

299
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.160
I'll teach that cheeky brat a

300
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.920
lesson!

301
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.720
Now!

302
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:23.900
I messed up.

303
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:34.420
What did you do to the prince?

304
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.920
It was a joke.

305
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.320
I'll never forget that cheeky gorilla!

306
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.780
I need to talk to you, kid.

307
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.220
What is it?

308
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.620
Is there something suspicious lurking in this

309
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:49.920
mansion?

310
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.280
Lurking in this mansion?

311
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.120
It seems to be the work of the

312
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.860
rebels of the Hondara Kingdom.

313
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.920
That means...

314
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.260
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

315
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880
It's serious, sir.

316
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.840
A terrorist has invaded the prince's mansion.

317
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.620
What?

318
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.880
All right!

319
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.120
Let's start with Chinese food.

320
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.280
This one, this one, this one, and this

321
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:27.380
one.

322
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.920
This should be enough.

323
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.340
Honey!

324
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.240
You bastard!

325
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.380
Stop right there!

326
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:44.620
Stop!

327
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.060
I'm too hungry to run.

328
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.860
Aim well.

329
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.200
I know.

330
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.180
Let's find the terrorist.

331
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.680
Where's Ryo?

332
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.060
He's no use to us.

333
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.080
First, we need to secure the guests' safety.

334
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.450
I'm faster!

335
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.210
You're being rude to the prince!

336
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.290
You're being rude to the prince!

337
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.530
This is mine!

338
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.660
What's going on?

339
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.840
What's going on?

340
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.020
Everyone!

341
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.580
It's dangerous!

342
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.460
Please stay back!

343
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.460
A terrorist has invaded this mansion!

344
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.180
My meat!

345
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.119
My meat!

346
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.619
My meat!

347
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.380
Damn it!

348
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:10.859
We failed again!

349
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.680
We have no choice.

350
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.720
Let's break in and save the prince.

351
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:37.630
Please calm down.

352
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.750
The center of this room is moving underground.

353
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.190
It's all right now.

354
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.970
My food!

355
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:45.530
I'm not kidding!

356
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.670
I haven't eaten anything yet!

357
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:51.910
Ryo!

358
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.950
Senpai!

359
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.950
Ryo!

360
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.640
Leave that idiot alone!

361
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.640
The terrorist is after the prince.

362
00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.220
We just need to evacuate the prince.

363
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.000
Prince!

364
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.080
Prince!

365
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.680
This is the worst.

366
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.640
Let go of me!

367
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.100
I'm going to eat you!

368
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.320
Idiot!

369
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.020
Stop it!

370
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.660
One last time!

371
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.500
Take this!

372
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.320
Senpai!

373
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.040
Prince!

374
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.300
Please get out of the room!

375
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:43.480
Prince!

376
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:43.940
Please get out of the room!

377
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.760
Now's not the time!

378
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.100
My favorite grilled chicken!

379
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.560
What?

380
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.880
I can't find it!

381
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.140
I'll eat you!

382
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.340
Idiot!

383
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:11.920
You can't do that!

384
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.120
The terrorist is coming!

385
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.660
He's here!

386
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.500
Hands up!

387
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.300
Idiot!

388
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.480
I told you now's not the time!

389
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.360
You did it!

390
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.440
Don't look down on us!

391
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.440
Damn it!

392
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:42.820
Prince!

393
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.740
I'm going to eat you!

394
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.480
Idiot!

395
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.040
Idiot!

396
00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.460
Prince!

397
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.880
Prince!

398
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.020
Idiot!

399
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.240
Where did the grilled chicken go?

400
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.060
Now!

401
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.600
What's that?

402
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.080
It's hypnotic gas.

403
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:19.780
Are you ready?

404
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:19.920
I'm ready.

405
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:28.730
Okay!

406
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:29.310
Arrest him!

407
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.390
Grilled chicken!

408
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.770
Where is it?

409
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.670
Grilled chicken!

410
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.950
Prince!

411
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.450
Grilled chicken!

412
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:39.610
Prince!

413
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:40.850
Do you recognize these guys?

414
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.990
Chief!

415
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:47.670
Too bad.

416
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.430
Don't move!

417
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.550
Drop your guns and raise your hands!

418
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.840
That's enough.

419
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.060
I'll send you to the other world.

420
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:07.880
Prince.

421
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.020
It's okay.

422
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.060
I just need you to turn on that

423
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:11.460
switch.

424
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:14.900
No!

425
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.680
No!

426
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.380
No!

427
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:16.960
No!

428
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.520
No!

429
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:17.960
Where's the grilled chicken?

430
00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.780
Where's my grilled chicken?

431
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.860
Grilled chicken!

432
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.420
Grilled chicken!

433
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.660
Maybe he's looking for a big chicken.

434
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.860
No way.

435
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.640
What are you talking about?

436
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.420
Are you praying?

437
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.540
Die as you wish.

438
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.780
Great!

439
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.920
Grilled chicken!

440
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.500
Let's eat!

441
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.810
We did it!

442
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.990
Chief!

443
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:56.390
We did it!

444
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.210
What's going on?

445
00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:58.570
We did it!

446
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.690
Chief turned on the switch!

447
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.010
We did it!

448
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.890
What's going on?

449
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.970
The grilled chicken...

450
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:05.970
Where's my grilled chicken?

451
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.290
I found it!

452
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.610
You did it, Ryo-chan!

453
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:16.430
You're the best!

454
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.070
Thanks to you, I was saved.

455
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.250
Thank you, Ryo-san.

456
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.830
This is nothing.

457
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:29.790
What's this?

458
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:29.890
What's this?

459
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:32.790
That's...

460
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.890
Everyone, help me!

461
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:50.710
It looks

462
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.790
like he turned on the emergency self-

463
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.390
destruct switch.

464
00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:59.170
Here.

465
00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.030
This is the chief's award.

466
00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.810
Ryo-chan, you did well.

467
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.270
I don't want that.

468
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:04.370
I don't want that.

469
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.790
Grilled chicken!

470
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.990
Sushi!

471
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.710
I want to eat a feast!

472
00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:12.610
He was shocked that he couldn't eat

473
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.290
the party food.

474
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.630
Hey, wait!

475
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.930
You are...

476
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:21.950
Thank you for saving me.

477
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.550
Last night was really fun.

478
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.050
Eat this for me.

479
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:27.670
Prince!

480
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:27.770
Prince!

481
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.650
He's really into it.

482
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.570
Wasabi!

483
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.170
You got me again!

484
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.130
You really are an idiot gorilla.

485
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.050
You brat!

486
00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.230
Prince!

487
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.000
This is Edokko.

488
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.720
Edokko doesn't want to fight

489
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.580
or eat sushi.

490
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.100
Edokko won't fit in such

491
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.680
a warm bath.

492
00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.760
Make it hotter!

493
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.580
It's not hot at all.

494
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.600
Next time, on Gekitotsu

495
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.280
Edokko Gassen.

496
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.060
Look forward to it!

497
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.330
Next time, on Gekitotsu

498
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:07.430
Edokko Gassen.
