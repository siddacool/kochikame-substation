00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.290
I've started running, my dream won't

11
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.310
do!

12
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.670
Even if it's just a little bit,

13
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.290
I don't want to see it I

14
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.610
'm excited, I'm curious I'm strong,

15
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:29.600
I'm tough, I'm strong Super

16
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:52.650
Rich, Shiratori Reiji What

17
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.610
's wrong, miss?

18
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.250
I'm hungry.

19
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.010
You haven't eaten lunch yet?

20
00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.450
No.

21
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.170
What about mommy?

22
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.220
I'm hungry.

23
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.460
I'm busy right now.

24
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.440
I told you to wait.

25
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.480
What are you doing?

26
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.740
Don't let such a cute girl eat

27
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.200
lunch.

28
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.340
Are you still a mother?

29
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.940
I'm a big man.

30
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.620
What right do you have to interfere?

31
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.060
It's none of your business, isn't

32
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.160
it?

33
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.520
What?

34
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500
Please let me go.

35
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.760
I'm really sorry.

36
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.400
I'll never leave my daughter alone again.

37
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.540
Mariko, let's go eat.

38
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.080
Okay.

39
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.980
Thank you.

40
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.840
What is it?

41
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.660
What's wrong?

42
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.480
Naoko, what's wrong?

43
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.160
Reiko, listen to me.

44
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.420
I asked for a ticket

45
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.800
at the parking lot earlier.

46
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.560
I'm going to pick you up.

47
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.740
I don't want to.

48
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.260
I don't want to get flowers like

49
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.360
this.

50
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.340
You're the perfect woman for my Porsche.

51
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.940
A rose like this is nothing more than

52
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.840
a substitute for you.

53
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.920
Is that so?

54
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.200
How about it?

55
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.120
Why don't we go for a drive

56
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.780
to Yokohama?

57
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.760
Let's go to a fancy restaurant and

58
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.460
eat while looking at the sunset.

59
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.100
But I'm still on a business trip.

60
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.140
It's rare to see a pearl white

61
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.560
Porsche.

62
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400
What?

63
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.540
What?

64
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.380
Oh, no.

65
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.940
If you insist, I'll get rid of

66
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.040
it as soon as possible.

67
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.180
What?

68
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.220
I can't believe there's a woman

69
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.100
in Japan who can recognize a pearl white

70
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.640
Porsche.

71
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.620
I'm glad.

72
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.820
Mado, Mado.

73
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.700
Do you want to say Mademois

74
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.820
elle?

75
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.840
That's right.

76
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.040
You're my ideal Mado.

77
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.140
Mado...

78
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.620
Mademoiselle.

79
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.740
In other words, the passenger seat of this

80
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.800
car was prepared for you.

81
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.940
Why don't we go for a drive

82
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.640
to Yokohama?

83
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.380
I'm sorry, but I prefer the driver

84
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.740
's seat to the passenger's seat.

85
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.660
Besides, it's better not to use words

86
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.580
you're not used to.

87
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.560
Yes.

88
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.240
Miss, I'm sorry to say this, but

89
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.760
I'm Super Rich Shiratori Reiji.

90
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.820
What?

91
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.060
You want to know where I went to

92
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.320
college?

93
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.700
Yes.

94
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.720
Of course, it's OK University.

95
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.340
I didn't ask you.

96
00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.820
Let's go.

97
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.940
What?

98
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.880
Where is your house?

99
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.180
Of course, it's in Dengen

100
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.620
Chofu.

101
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.360
It has 150 homes.

102
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.180
What?

103
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.200
It's the best?

104
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It's not a big deal.

105
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.620
You should be proud of yourself as soon

106
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.720
as possible.

107
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.820
Watch out!

108
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.560
You have to pay the fine, you jerk!

109
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.260
I don't want to hear those ugly

110
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.760
words.

111
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.240
Miss, I have a Porsche.

112
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.320
You can't run away from me.

113
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.300
He's coming after us.

114
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.200
Porsche can't catch up with us.

115
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.100
Don't worry.

116
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.000
That driver can't catch up with us.

117
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.940
Damn it!

118
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.280
Can't you keep up with my fast

119
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.600
shift?

120
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.200
You, you, you!

121
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.020
I heard that there are more women with

122
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.780
Pachinko addiction.

123
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.120
I didn't know there was such a

124
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.540
mother.

125
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.080
It's a big social problem.

126
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.140
What?

127
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.500
You said it's a social problem.

128
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.560
It's a good thing to be interested

129
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.940
in social problems.

130
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.740
Is that so?

131
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.720
Thanks to more women, I can't pay

132
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.080
the fine.

133
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.400
I have to do something.

134
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.140
You idiot!

135
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.260
How dare you!

136
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.080
He's...

137
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.180
I knew it.

138
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.400
I'm screwed.

139
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.100
What's wrong, Miss?

140
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.580
The man in the Porsche is grumbling.

141
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.180
He finally stopped.

142
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.800
The Porsche will cry.

143
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.400
Damn it!

144
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.360
Why did he stop?

145
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.440
You, you, you!

146
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.040
He's a terrible driver.

147
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.500
Who is he?

148
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.620
A diamond Rolex on his left hand.

149
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.720
A jacket and a coat around his waist.

150
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.960
A Fantics necktie.

151
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.200
A Heragamo shoes.

152
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.960
I have 10 million yen.

153
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.040
My name is Reiji Shiratori.

154
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.680
Is he a relative of Super Saiyan?

155
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.400
No!

156
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.520
He's just an idiot.

157
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.880
Let's go back.

158
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.620
Hey!

159
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.380
How dare you ignore me?

160
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.340
I'll praise you.

161
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.900
Don't come in!

162
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.380
I don't need you.

163
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:03.920
I don't need you.

164
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.220
Get out of my way.

165
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.080
I need you.

166
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.420
You.

167
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.540
I hate you.

168
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.500
I hate you for making me fall in

169
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.620
love with you.

170
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.460
I'm busy today.

171
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.220
See you later.

172
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.680
No, no.

173
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.140
You can't run away from me.

174
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.780
You're a lucky man who can ride

175
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.480
my Porsche.

176
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.480
I don't want to ride your Porsche.

177
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.840
I stopped at that place.

178
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.380
I'm not an idiot.

179
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.299
I know.

180
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.460
Don't lie to me.

181
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.900
Let's go for a drive with my

182
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.320
Porsche.

183
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.640
I'm on duty.

184
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.380
Let's have a meal together.

185
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.700
There's a restaurant in Ginza.

186
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.660
I have something to do tonight.

187
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.420
Where is my house?

188
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.620
It's in 150-tsubo

189
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:57.720
in Reien-chofu.

190
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960
I've been there.

191
00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.680
Really?

192
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.180
Is he your father?

193
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.320
You're talking to yourself.

194
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.280
He's the president of Shiratori Iron

195
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:06.400
works.

196
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.920
I'm going to be the president.

197
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.360
Isn't it great?

198
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.420
I told you that you can't run

199
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:13.700
away from me.

200
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.520
Shiratori Ironworks is a first-

201
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:18.960
class company.

202
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.200
I've seen it on TV commercials.

203
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.360
It's a company where parents and children

204
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.860
talk on the beach.

205
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.020
Do you know that?

206
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.690
My father is a stubborn man.

207
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:35.830
He deals with iron.

208
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.150
He was taken away.

209
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.450
Shiratori Ironworks is aiming for tomorrow.

210
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.150
My father is in that commercial.

211
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.930
Isn't it great?

212
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.070
I was impressed.

213
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.010
Shut up.

214
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.450
You've been complaining.

215
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.650
That's why I don't like super

216
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.270
poor people.

217
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:02.790
Reiko.

218
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.530
If you want to run away, you have

219
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.130
to go to his right.

220
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.170
You don't even know how hard it

221
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:10.270
is.

222
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.590
Don't be a nuisance.

223
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.410
How many times do I have to tell

224
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.510
you?

225
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.350
What are you doing with me?

226
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.410
What are you doing?

227
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.930
Don't underestimate me.

228
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.670
I will never give up.

229
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.950
I will make your heart ache.

230
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.050
He's still complaining.

231
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.470
Wait for me.

232
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.640
What is Shiratori doing?

233
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.780
I think he's still in the hospital.

234
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.060
He's rich, but he's different from

235
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.000
Reiko Nakagawa.

236
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.860
Shiratori is...

237
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.440
I think it's because of my father.

238
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.240
Do you know?

239
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.720
Shiratori Ironworks is a subsidiary

240
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.440
of my father's company.

241
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.920
Is that so?

242
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.700
Did you attack the daughter of the parent

243
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:23.980
company?

244
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.900
He's a stupid man.

245
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.860
I hope he's okay.

246
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.480
It's a luxury to drive.

247
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.440
Poor people.

248
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.600
You have to work hard every day.

249
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.140
I can't hear you.

250
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.060
Come to the exit.

251
00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.880
Shut up.

252
00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.400
Shut up.

253
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.460
It's not the exit.

254
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.420
I stopped at that place on purpose.

255
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.800
He's still doing weird things.

256
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.500
Miss.

257
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.660
I'll take you for a drive today.

258
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.340
I'm going to the exit, so I

259
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:15.460
don't want to.

260
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:16.940
Shut up.

261
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.400
You shouldn't force yourself to ride a

262
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:18.620
Porsche.

263
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.160
It's rude.

264
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.240
You.

265
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.460
You're pretty handsome.

266
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.800
Are you his girlfriend?

267
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:33.780
Yes.

268
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.200
Even if you're his girlfriend, you can

269
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.680
't beat me.

270
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.600
Because I'm rich.

271
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.960
I have a good face.

272
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.420
I'm smart.

273
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.820
I have all three of them.

274
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.600
And...

275
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.040
I have a Porsche.

276
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.620
I have a Porsche.

277
00:12:53.020 --> 00:13:02.700
He's using magic.

278
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.020
I don't want to go to town.

279
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.680
I have a Porsche.

280
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.040
Shut up.

281
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.800
Shut up.

282
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.380
Shut up.

283
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.140
Shut up.

284
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.160
Shut up.

285
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.280
When I look at the screen, I feel

286
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:20.600
sick.

287
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:20.800
I feel sick.

288
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.540
I can't believe you hit me.

289
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.320
You don't know how hard it is.

290
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.160
How much is your salary?

291
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.540
It's about 220,000 yen.

292
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.540
Then I'll give you the same amount

293
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.480
as this pair of shoes.

294
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.600
What?

295
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.900
I can only buy one pair of shoes

296
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.000
with my salary?

297
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.240
I'm so miserable.

298
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.800
How old are you?

299
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.640
I don't know.

300
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.360
It's about 7 million yen.

301
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.680
Then I'll give you the same amount

302
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.860
as this Rolex watch.

303
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.040
Then I'll give you the same amount

304
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.580
as this gold watch.

305
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.260
I did it again.

306
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.560
Don't underestimate the super rich Shiratori

307
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.040
Reiji.

308
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.980
Now you know the difference between super rich

309
00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.700
and super poor.

310
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.740
It looks like you know.

311
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.200
You look poor compared to these poor people.

312
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.460
Let's go to a rich restaurant.

313
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.120
Let's go to a rich restaurant.

314
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.460
That's enough.

315
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.440
Reiko is angry.

316
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.400
I've been listening to you for a

317
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:26.500
while.

318
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.680
Stop it, Reiko.

319
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.780
Let go of me, Ryo.

320
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.740
Calm down, Reiko.

321
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.140
Don't you feel sorry for being told

322
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.240
that?

323
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.100
Ryo is doing his best.

324
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.860
That's true.

325
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.720
But I don't know what he'll

326
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.360
do if his pride is hurt.

327
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.160
Go out with him for a meal.

328
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.100
What?

329
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.360
Of course, I'm not alone.

330
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.580
My work is almost over.

331
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.900
Nagagawa and I will go with

332
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.520
him as bodyguards.

333
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.040
I see.

334
00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.920
You're going to go out with him

335
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.020
for a meal.

336
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.320
I'm just a bodyguard.

337
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.120
I understand.

338
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.380
Ryo, you're coming with me.

339
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.480
All right.

340
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.800
Why do I have to treat them to

341
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.240
a meal?

342
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.820
Did he say anything?

343
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.320
No.

344
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.540
He said that sometimes it's good to

345
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.880
make poor people feel rich.

346
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.620
My Ferrari can take four people.

347
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.480
If you go with a Ferrari, his pride

348
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.080
will be hurt.

349
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.560
You have to treat him to a meal.

350
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.540
Reiko is like a pet.

351
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.380
That's what super poor people think.

352
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.260
But I don't know what to do

353
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.360
with that driver.

354
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.680
He's been driving for a long time.

355
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.100
Reiko Akimoto.

356
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.080
That's a nice name.

357
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.880
Where do you live?

358
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.180
I live in Hiro.

359
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.400
It's a high-class residential area.

360
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.420
Do you live with your parents?

361
00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.480
No, I live alone.

362
00:15:59.480 --> 00:15:59.600
I live alone.

363
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.200
Do you live in a one-room

364
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.740
apartment?

365
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.280
It's a four-bedroom apartment.

366
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.360
Is that so?

367
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.460
You must have a high rent.

368
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.140
My father bought it for me, so I

369
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:13.500
don't have to pay the rent.

370
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.820
You must have been rich.

371
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.120
Where do you live?

372
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.400
I live in Ashiya.

373
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.760
It's a remote-controlled house in

374
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:21.860
Kansai.

375
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.800
Do you live in a house of 150

376
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.360
square meters?

377
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.200
I live in a house of 200 square

378
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:29.300
meters.

379
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.120
I live in a house of 300 square

380
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.220
meters.

381
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.360
I live in a house of 500 square

382
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:33.460
meters.

383
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.320
I live in a house of 500 square

384
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:35.420
meters.

385
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.040
Stupid.

386
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.840
Don't be impatient.

387
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.120
I live in a house of 500 square

388
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.220
meters.

389
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:50.740
It's a remote-controlled house in

390
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:50.960
Ashiya.

391
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.060
By the way, I'm a high school

392
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.160
student.

393
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.940
Where did you go to college?

394
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.560
I went to Shohin University.

395
00:16:59.300 --> 00:16:59.900
I won.

396
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.160
That's a good university for young girls.

397
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.380
I heard that you can enter the university

398
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.680
by escalator from the kindergarten.

399
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.460
I went to the university.

400
00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.339
Until then, I went to the University of

401
00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:10.740
St. Paul.

402
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.560
I don't know such a university.

403
00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.619
It's a very strict school.

404
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.760
Don't you know it?

405
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.880
I know it.

406
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.400
I think it was in Chiba.

407
00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:22.900
It's in Switzerland.

408
00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:24.200
Switzerland.

409
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.320
Mr. Shiratori.

410
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.560
Would you like to change your driving?

411
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.540
I'm fine.

412
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.680
But there's a lot of traffic behind

413
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:35.780
you.

414
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:36.520
What?

415
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.320
Stupid.

416
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.800
Don't be impatient.

417
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:50.880
Oh, you

418
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.360
changed to A-class.

419
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.520
A-class license.

420
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.000
Did you drive?

421
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.300
Don't miss it.

422
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.840
Yes.

423
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:14.140
It's

424
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:14.580
too good.

425
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.390
I often come to this shop.

426
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.590
It's good.

427
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.970
This is Mr. Akimoto.

428
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.090
Oh, Mr. Nakagawa.

429
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:33.610
Welcome.

430
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.890
Thank you.

431
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.430
Come here.

432
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.390
Hey.

433
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.270
Why don't you greet me?

434
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.970
Excuse me.

435
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.970
Who are you?

436
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.910
Don't be rude.

437
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.230
I'm Shiratori Reiji who made

438
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.330
a reservation.

439
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.130
I'll pay the bill.

440
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.330
I'm sorry.

441
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.410
I made a reservation for two people.

442
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.550
I'll show you to the table for

443
00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:58.650
four people.

444
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.510
Come here.

445
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.030
But Reiko...

446
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.330
I didn't expect you to come to

447
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.230
this five-star restaurant.

448
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.810
I've been here once or twice.

449
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.210
You've only been here once or twice.

450
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.930
Don't surprise me.

451
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.710
I come here twice a week.

452
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.410
Hey, super rich man.

453
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:22.930
Don't lose.

454
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.110
It's not about the number of times.

455
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.350
It's about how much you spend at

456
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.450
once.

457
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.470
You can order anything you want.

458
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.410
You're a super rich man.

459
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:40.910
Am I?

460
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.170
You're wrong.

461
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:42.230
Am I?

462
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.890
I searched this restaurant on the Tokyo date

463
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.190
map.

464
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.450
But I couldn't find this restaurant.

465
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.890
Sir.

466
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.390
Did you order?

467
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.330
Order?

468
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.090
I can't read it.

469
00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.210
I'll write it in French.

470
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.610
Hey, what are you doing?

471
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.210
All the dishes here are delicious.

472
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.810
I don't know what to do.

473
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.410
What should I do?

474
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.210
I'll order everything from the top.

475
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.770
Why don't you leave it to the

476
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:17.870
chef?

477
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.550
Oh, no.

478
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.930
I was going to do that, too.

479
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.850
Super rich people get along well.

480
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.250
I'll do that, too.

481
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.650
I'll do that, too.

482
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:33.170
Yes, sir.

483
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:33.550
Yes, sir.

484
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.170
Mr. Akimoto and Mr. Nakagawa.

485
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.770
This is a set.

486
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.690
Welcome.

487
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.490
If you don't mind, the VIP room

488
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:44.930
is available.

489
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.450
Did you find out that I'm the

490
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.370
vice president of Shiratori Tekko?

491
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.430
I'll order it right away.

492
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.910
Yes, sir.

493
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.350
It's okay here.

494
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.950
Goodbye.

495
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.010
Wait a minute.

496
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.510
I told you I'd go.

497
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.050
Damn it.

498
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.470
Well, I'm a super rich man.

499
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.970
Don't worry about it.

500
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.630
Sometimes I wanted to eat at a common

501
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.030
er's seat.

502
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.470
Can I order a steak, too?

503
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.530
Go ahead.

504
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.390
One more steak, please.

505
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.370
Oh, Ryo.

506
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.330
I'd like a Bordeaux steak

507
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.430
from 1982.

508
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.670
I think 1983 is better than 1982.

509
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.950
As expected of Mr. Nakagawa.

510
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.470
Hey!

511
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.870
I'm the super rich man who pays

512
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.970
the bill.

513
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.790
Why don't you ask me?

514
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:40.750
What?

515
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.790
Why don't you ask him instead of

516
00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:43.890
me?

517
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.030
Why do you all ignore me?

518
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.570
Hey, Meiji.

519
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.190
Dad.

520
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.610
Oh, is that the president's son?

521
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.750
Yes.

522
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.190
Wait a minute.

523
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.850
I didn't know you were here, either.

524
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.950
Dad, you're as busy as ever.

525
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.890
Keep it a secret from Mom.

526
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.750
Hey, isn't she a good girl?

527
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.290
Where does she come from?

528
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.790
I don't like her.

529
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.110
Unlike my dad, I don't get along

530
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.530
with my sister, Domia.

531
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.150
But I'll get rid of her right

532
00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:17.710
away.

533
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.350
Let me introduce you.

534
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.850
This is...

535
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.730
Good evening, uncle.

536
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.370
Do you know him?

537
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.110
Y-You!

538
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.370
This old man is Akimoto's son.

539
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:35.010
He's an idiot.

540
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:36.290
He's not like you.

541
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.110
I'm sorry for being rude to your

542
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.210
son.

543
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.130
Uncle, you don't have to do that.

544
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.830
It's nothing.

545
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.830
Akimoto's son is one of my

546
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.250
employees.

547
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.570
D-Dad.

548
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.670
Please forgive me for not knowing you.

549
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.070
I didn't mean to...

550
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.970
He's a super rich guy.

551
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.670
I wonder what Shiratori's been up

552
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:03.770
to.

553
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:06.990
I did something bad to him.

554
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.250
You have no responsibility.

555
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:10.970
He's the one who called me.

556
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.890
But...

557
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:14.950
Hello, everyone.

558
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.990
You are...

559
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.410
S-Shiratori.

560
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.630
What happened to your outfit?

561
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.850
After that, my dad impressed me and I

562
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.010
became super poor.

563
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.450
I'm really sorry.

564
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.010
Don't worry.

565
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.290
I'll get rich soon and become super

566
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.070
rich.

567
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.750
Until then, goodbye.

568
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.430
He's so stubborn.

569
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.550
I hope you become super rich soon and

570
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.230
treat me to a meal.

571
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.490
Hey, super rich!

572
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:50.670
Hey, super rich!

573
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.230
Applause!

574
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.480
Why am I digging a tunnel?

575
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.140
I saw it in a movie.

576
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.340
It's an escape.

577
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.200
The director locked me up.

578
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.680
He's digging a hole to escape.

579
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.240
Wait for me, director.

580
00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.540
I'm going to get my revenge.

581
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.800
Next time, Ryo's Escape.

582
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.760
Don't miss it!

583
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:36.230
