(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Ryotsu and Reiko This is

2
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.110
the latest handstand.

3
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.130
It's compact and stronger than steel.

4
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.150
How do you use it?

5
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.950
Let me see your hand.

6
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.070
Yes.

7
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.050
If you touch the inside of the notebook

8
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.950
like this...

9
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.010
Ah!

10
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.410
It will automatically lock.

11
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.070
Really?

12
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.010
The key is to open it using this

13
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.850
electronic lock key.

14
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.390
Wow, that was quick.

15
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.150
Now we don't have to worry about

16
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.250
arresting criminals.

17
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.890
Finally, the guys from the police force are

18
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.370
here.

19
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.550
Today was a tough day.

20
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.750
Ryo-chan, you look really sleepy.

21
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.830
You're right, Ryo-chan.

22
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.670
I'm not sleepy at all.

23
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.050
Five days ago, I went to the beach

24
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.150
in the middle of the night.

25
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.010
Every night, I sang and drank all night.

26
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.330
After that, I played with the iro

27
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.990
n plate for about 70 hours.

28
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.050
And I fell asleep right away.

29
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.430
I haven't slept for about 120 hours.

30
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.850
That's crazy.

31
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.950
When I get home, I'll sleep for

32
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.810
about 100 hours.

33
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.970
I can't sleep.

34
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.030
I'm tired.

35
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.010
You have to change your lifestyle.

36
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.210
Yeah, I can't do that.

37
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.950
Huh?

38
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.850
What's that?

39
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.790
This?

40
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.450
It's a new type of notebook.

41
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.690
Look.

42
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.830
It locks in 0.

43
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.850
2 seconds.

44
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.850
Wow, that's interesting.

45
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.450
I can just touch it?

46
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.890
That's convenient.

47
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.330
You can open it using this key.

48
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.830
That's cool.

49
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.950
This is fun.

50
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.810
It's fast.

51
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.830
You looked so sleepy just now.

52
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.450
You can't see what you're playing

53
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.550
with.

54
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.110
Well, we're done playing.

55
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.770
Let's go home.

56
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.730
A little more.

57
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.910
I want this.

58
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.470
If you're tired, you should go home

59
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.670
and sleep.

60
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.410
Just like the kids.

61
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.730
What did you say?

62
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.930
Sorry, kids!

63
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.750
You're under arrest!

64
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.110
What?

65
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.610
The key!

66
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.590
I ate it!

67
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.690
Hey!

68
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.950
Damn it!

69
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.730
He got away!

70
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.770
What are you going to do with this?

71
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.670
I don't know!

72
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.210
Hey, do something!

73
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.010
Nakagawa!

74
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.250
It's not me.

75
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.550
Mr. Terai borrowed it from

76
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.970
the head office.

77
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.490
I'll ask him.

78
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.829
There should be a spare key.

79
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.170
That's right.

80
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.070
He ran away because you yelled at him.

81
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.570
You should have just caught him.

82
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.230
You're the one who dropped the key.

83
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.290
Is that so?

84
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.970
Yes.

85
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.930
That's strange.

86
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.430
The person in charge went on a vacation

87
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.530
in China.

88
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.290
What?

89
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.110
What did you say?

90
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.130
When are you coming back?

91
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.990
It's supposed to be the day after

92
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.090
tomorrow.

93
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.110
What?

94
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.930
Are you going to stay with Reiko

95
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.990
for 48 hours?

96
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.730
That's my line.

97
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.590
Wait a minute.

98
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.330
Is it Saturday today?

99
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.510
I think so.

100
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.450
I'm not kidding!

101
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.810
It's a holiday!

102
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.430
I don't have time to do this.

103
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.870
I have to do something.

104
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.190
That's the latest style.

105
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.050
I can't get a scratch.

106
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.650
I've had a bad feeling since I

107
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.750
was playing on the floor.

108
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.110
I'm sorry, but I have something to

109
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.210
do.

110
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.270
I'll go home first.

111
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.190
What?

112
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.810
Hey!

113
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.790
Wait!

114
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.210
Ryo will work with me.

115
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.110
What?

116
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.810
Wait a minute.

117
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.890
I haven't slept for 120 hours.

118
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.350
Are you going to make me work for

119
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.410
another 8 hours?

120
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.310
I can't help it.

121
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.370
Today is a day off.

122
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.910
Why do you have to work?

123
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.310
Okay.

124
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.410
You can do whatever you want.

125
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.930
Of course.

126
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.790
I'm going to sleep.

127
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.370
Wow.

128
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.370
It didn't take a second.

129
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.850
You can sleep anywhere.

130
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.090
You're just like an animal.

131
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.590
You're just like an animal.

132
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.630
Yes.

133
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.730
I'm at the Kamiwari

134
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.970
Park.

135
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.790
Yes, I'm here.

136
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.450
Reiko, there's a phone call for

137
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.550
you.

138
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.430
For me?

139
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.310
Ouch!

140
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.550
You must have woken up.

141
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.190
Come here.

142
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.610
Hey!

143
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.470
Yes, I'm back.

144
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.870
Yes.

145
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.930
What?

146
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.690
Right now?

147
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.850
Yes, I understand.

148
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.190
My head is burning!

149
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.490
Hey!

150
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.210
What are you doing?

151
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.010
We're going to the library.

152
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.150
No!

153
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.190
I'm on leave.

154
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.810
I'm not going!

155
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.430
What are you doing?

156
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.990
Hey!

157
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.870
He's in a hurry.

158
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.190
Hey!

159
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.290
Let's go.

160
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.970
Wait!

161
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.930
Reiko!

162
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.910
Why do I have to run?

163
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.930
It can't be helped.

164
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.010
It's forbidden to ride with Gents

165
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.130
uki.

166
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.550
But I'll let you go.

167
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.330
Hang in there.

168
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.730
Stop it!

169
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.390
You're not lazy anymore, are you?

170
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.270
What did you say?

171
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.710
That was definitely a new world record!

172
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.190
Put your hands together.

173
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.550
It's embarrassing to be found.

174
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.010
They're a bold couple.

175
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.750
They're beautiful beasts.

176
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.750
Stop.

177
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.830
What?

178
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.470
This way.

179
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.850
I want to pee.

180
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:38.930
What?

181
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.630
We can't go together.

182
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.530
What do you mean?

183
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.210
What are you going to do?

184
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.130
I'll hold you.

185
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.590
I'm in trouble.

186
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.530
I know.

187
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.090
Why don't we hide in the back

188
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.270
yard?

189
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.250
Why don't we hide in the back

190
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.350
yard?

191
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.410
Are you telling me to hide in the

192
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:54.510
back yard?

193
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:03.020
I can't stand it anymore.

194
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.580
Hurry up.

195
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.220
I don't like it.

196
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.460
Why do I have to do this?

197
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:10.920
Reiko!

198
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.740
What are you doing in such a place?

199
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.880
I'm playing hide-and-se

200
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:15.980
ek.

201
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.080
No.

202
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.860
It's not like you.

203
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.300
Let's play volleyball together.

204
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.260
No!

205
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.020
It's too early.

206
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.850
I told you it's too early.

207
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.270
You're treating me like a pervert.

208
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:41.669
I can't stand it anymore.

209
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.250
Excuse me.

210
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:45.730
Thank you.

211
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:50.710
Ryo.

212
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.970
Are you done?

213
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.290
Let's go home.

214
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.290
Excuse me.

215
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.910
What?

216
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.390
Toilet?

217
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.610
If I go in with you, you'll

218
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:01.330
become a real pervert.

219
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.230
Go outside like me.

220
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.310
I'll close my eyes.

221
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.370
I can't do that.

222
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.810
Then hold on until we get home.

223
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.350
There's only one way.

224
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.610
How?

225
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.450
Like this.

226
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.970
Like this.

227
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.410
I can't stand it anymore.

228
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.150
You're treating me like a pervert.

229
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.220
I'm tired.

230
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.760
My left arm hurts.

231
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.860
I'm tired, too.

232
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.540
I can't sleep, so I'm pulling

233
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:44.800
around.

234
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.880
I'm sweating.

235
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.100
Let's take a bath.

236
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.220
Bath?

237
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.380
It's okay.

238
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.780
I won't look at you.

239
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.120
What are you looking at?

240
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.620
How dare you!

241
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.360
How dare you treat me like a per

242
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.460
vert!

243
00:09:59.180 --> 00:09:59.780
Ryo.

244
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.540
But just in case.

245
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.880
Damn it.

246
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.300
You made me faint again.

247
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.640
Don't hit me every time I change

248
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.320
my clothes or go to the bathroom.

249
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.260
You're getting more and more resistant.

250
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.860
You'll notice it sooner or later.

251
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.000
You hate me like a cockroach.

252
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.040
Are you going to take a bath alone?

253
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.740
Let me in, too.

254
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.540
Wait.

255
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.400
I'll be right out.

256
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.520
No, right now.

257
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.440
Don't get naked in a place like

258
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:33.540
this.

259
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.420
If you're going in, just go in.

260
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.920
Don't be ridiculous.

261
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:38.700
Damn it.

262
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.600
But how did you change your clothes when

263
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.560
your hands were tied?

264
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.240
Huh?

265
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.340
It's a little trick.

266
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.930
I feel refreshed.

267
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.650
I don't feel refreshed at all.

268
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.470
I'm going to take a bath in

269
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.570
my clothes.

270
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.050
I told you to go in.

271
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.610
I wonder who it is.

272
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.570
Akimoto-san.

273
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.830
It's the manager's aunt.

274
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.610
She's famous for her talkative personality.

275
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.930
I don't know what kind of rumors

276
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.570
will spread if I find a place like

277
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:18.670
this.

278
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.570
You don't have to tell me anything.

279
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.250
I can't do that.

280
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:29.330
Yes.

281
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.890
Sorry to keep you waiting.

282
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.430
Oh, you're taking a bath?

283
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.990
Your luggage is here.

284
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.830
Thank you.

285
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.050
Bye.

286
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.150
Oh, yeah.

287
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.230
Do you know the girl in room 8?

288
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.190
I don't like rumors.

289
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.030
She brings a different man into her room

290
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.130
every day.

291
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.590
You're a good girl.

292
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.610
You're different from all the other girls.

293
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.210
You're different from all the other girls.

294
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.670
You're not a strange man.

295
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.990
This girl is tough.

296
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:15.990
Let's go to bed.

297
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.430
Let's get changed.

298
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.090
What?

299
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.810
You fell asleep without doing anything.

300
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.810
If you sleep in a place like that,

301
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.590
you'll catch a cold.

302
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.590
It's not impossible.

303
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.930
I've been awake for 135 hours.

304
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.410
Yes?

305
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:37.250
It's Papa.

306
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.850
It's Pyunpyunmaru.

307
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.270
What's the matter, Papa, at this hour?

308
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.210
I'm on my way over there.

309
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.450
Oh, to Tokyo?

310
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.350
What is it?

311
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.370
What?

312
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.150
A matchmaking?

313
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.790
I haven't heard of it.

314
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.250
That's strange.

315
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.290
Anyway, at 1 o'clock tomorrow, the other

316
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.050
party will be my business partner, Tenka

317
00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.310
maru.

318
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.230
But even if you say that so suddenly

319
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.490
...

320
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.850
Besides, I don't want to get married

321
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.310
yet.

322
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.150
Do you have someone you like?

323
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.910
It's not like that, but...

324
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.830
Boss, I didn't do it.

325
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.290
Reiko, what was that man's voice

326
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.390
just now?

327
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.690
No, Papa, it was the sound of the

328
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.790
TV.

329
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.230
Oh, come on, Ryo-chan.

330
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:20.730
What?

331
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.190
The TV?

332
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.870
Stop it, Reiko.

333
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.450
Stop it.

334
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.290
I'm sure it was Reiko just

335
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:25.390
now.

336
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.650
Oh, it was the TV.

337
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.630
Oh, I see.

338
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.470
Well, see you tomorrow.

339
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.170
Good night.

340
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.990
Oh, I'm in trouble.

341
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.190
If I take Ryo-chan with

342
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.170
me like this, it'll be a big

343
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.370
mess.

344
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.410
Papa might fall asleep in shock.

345
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.070
I think it's about time, but I

346
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:53.590
'm sorry.

347
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.890
No, I don't mind being a little

348
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.290
late.

349
00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.530
If it's for Reiko, I'll

350
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.310
wait as long as it takes.

351
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.170
Right, Papa?

352
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:03.910
I think so.

353
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.410
Excuse me.

354
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.430
Oh, is it Reiko?

355
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.210
Thank you for waiting.

356
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.390
I'm sorry.

357
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.190
I got caught in a traffic jam.

358
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.430
Let me help you.

359
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.710
Here we go.

360
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.890
Isn't it cute?

361
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.430
I love it.

362
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.790
It's always with me wherever I go.

363
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.030
Ryo-chan's been asleep since

364
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.130
yesterday.

365
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.730
If I let her sleep like this, she

366
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.450
'll be able to do anything.

367
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.090
You're so cute, Reiko.

368
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.510
I like that about you.

369
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.850
Oh, thank you.

370
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.130
As you know, I love Tenkamar

371
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.250
u.

372
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.750
I'm Tenkamaru Shoji's

373
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.190
grandfather.

374
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:51.370
I'm Ryo-chan.

375
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.230
I'm happy to be close to A

376
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.910
kimoto Trade.

377
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.970
Nice to meet you, too.

378
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.490
What's your hobby?

379
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.830
I like spending money.

380
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.270
I have so much money, it's hard

381
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:06.370
to spend it.

382
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.470
That's a good hobby.

383
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.110
What's your hobby, Reiko?

384
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.190
In my imagination...

385
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.190
Ouch.

386
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.770
Oh, poor thing.

387
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.330
Did you fall?

388
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.770
You said you were open.

389
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.890
I said I wanted to see you.

390
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.650
Is that so?

391
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:28.170
I'm honored.

392
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.770
Excuse me.

393
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.670
So that's what happened.

394
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.890
So that's why I'm wearing a

395
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:40.710
raccoon costume.

396
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.890
Ryo-chan, please.

397
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:43.990
I'm sorry.

398
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.210
Please don't tell anyone until we're

399
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.310
done.

400
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.290
You...

401
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.950
Do you like that kind of guy?

402
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.110
No, I don't.

403
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.430
He's an important partner for me and

404
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.530
my dad.

405
00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.590
If it goes well, I'll buy you

406
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.190
the radio-controlled helicopter you

407
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:00.290
wanted.

408
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:01.910
What?

409
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.710
A radio-controlled helicopter?

410
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.210
Okay, I'll take it.

411
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.170
Leave it to me.

412
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.210
It seems you have a lot on your

413
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.310
plate.

414
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.990
It's hard to stay still, even though

415
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.090
I have a radio-controlled helicopter.

416
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.230
It looks delicious.

417
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.090
There's also sake.

418
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.010
Come to think of it, I haven't

419
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.730
eaten anything since last night.

420
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.550
Okay, watch me.

421
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.750
Anyway, my Tenkamaru family...

422
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.370
The first generation heir is the mother of

423
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.050
Himiko.

424
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.730
Oh, Ryo-chan.

425
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.510
This is nothing.

426
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.850
Reiko-san.

427
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.690
Yes?

428
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.910
If you were to get married, where would

429
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.110
you like to live?

430
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.930
Ashiya or Den'en Chof

431
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.070
u?

432
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:52.750
I don't mind anywhere.

433
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.250
Is that so?

434
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.790
I don't mind anywhere other than downtown.

435
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.890
What?

436
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.630
Hang in there.

437
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.990
It's for the radio-controlled helicopter.

438
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.890
You know, downtown is old-fashioned and

439
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.430
old-fashioned.

440
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:05.770
Darn it.

441
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:06.730
I don't like it.

442
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.250
I don't like downtown at all.

443
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.790
It's so shabby, I hate

444
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:12.890
it.

445
00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:14.710
What do you think, Reiko-san?

446
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.430
It's delicious.

447
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.690
Water!

448
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.730
Water!

449
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.750
Water!

450
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.910
Water!

451
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.690
Water, please!

452
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.950
Water!

453
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:42.790
Captain!

454
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:43.730
Ashitaka!

455
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.270
Excuse me.

456
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.510
How about it?

457
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.590
Why don't you two talk somewhere?

458
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.810
That's a good idea.

459
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.210
Young people are young people.

460
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.390
Right, Tenkamaru-san?

461
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.350
That's right.

462
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.240
Reiko-san.

463
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.840
Yes?

464
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.420
We're finally alone.

465
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.240
Y-Yes.

466
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.380
Reiko-san, ever since I saw

467
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.380
you for the first time...

468
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.500
Um...

469
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.440
Reiko-san...

470
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.780
There's a Dragon King show over there!

471
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.440
What?

472
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.580
Dragon King?

473
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.050
Maybe it was just my imagination.

474
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.330
It looked like a raccoon was running.

475
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.850
Dragon King!

476
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:41.950
Dragon King!

477
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.230
Dragon Jack!

478
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.690
Dragon King!

479
00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:56.690
Dragon King!

480
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.730
Sometimes, this kind of thing is nice.

481
00:18:58.810 --> 00:18:59.470
Y-Yes.

482
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:00.910
This is a good chance.

483
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.610
That's right, Dragon King.

484
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.730
Over there!

485
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.010
Dragon King!

486
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.430
Oh, what's wrong?

487
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.610
What's wrong?

488
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.710
It's nothing.

489
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.170
That's weird.

490
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.210
Calm down, calm down.

491
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.550
Dragon Jack!

492
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:24.510
Look out!

493
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.190
It's Kachikachi Mountain's

494
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.450
raccoon!

495
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.970
Ryuu-chan, let's go!

496
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.430
Help me!

497
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.670
It's very shallow.

498
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.990
But I'm glad.

499
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.550
At least half of your face is safe.

500
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.590
Damn.

501
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.050
But I'm in trouble.

502
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.470
At this rate...

503
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.870
Reiko!

504
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:57.950
Reiko!

505
00:19:58.890 --> 00:19:59.530
What should we do?

506
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:00.310
We'll be found!

507
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.070
What should we do, Tatsuya?

508
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.090
Reiko!

509
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:04.970
Reiko!

510
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.030
Why are you so sloppy?

511
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.890
Why are you here?

512
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:15.710
It's your turn.

513
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.670
Come on!

514
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:17.010
Hurry up!

515
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.210
Come on!

516
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.610
You're here, General Devil!

517
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.490
But...

518
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:29.250
Who is this girl?

519
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.510
Dragon King!

520
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:32.770
I'm a big fan!

521
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.870
Hey!

522
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.810
King Devil!

523
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:40.590
Take this!

524
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:49.590
General Devil!

525
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.230
King Devil is here!

526
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.410
What are you doing, idiot?

527
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.090
Reiko, you do it, too!

528
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:57.230
What?

529
00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.510
What's wrong with him?

530
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.810
He's serious.

531
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.810
If he's serious, let's do it,

532
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:02.430
too!

533
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:03.310
Yeah!

534
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.590
It can't be helped.

535
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:19.940
I can't believe it.

536
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:21.600
It's okay.

537
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.700
Don't worry about them.

538
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.740
Go, Sora!

539
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.780
Reiko!

540
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.220
Where did she go?

541
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.400
Reiko, you're so wonderful!

542
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.320
Reiko!

543
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:47.860
Reiko!

544
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.180
What are you doing?

545
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.160
You don't look good for Tenka

546
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.800
maru's family.

547
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.560
It was a mess.

548
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.560
But I'm relieved that we finally got

549
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:08.800
the manual.

550
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.280
It was a big deal with just one

551
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:11.540
manual.

552
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.720
But maybe you're still lucky.

553
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.520
The person in charge will be away for

554
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.400
a month from today.

555
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.120
A month?

556
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:21.980
That's dangerous!

557
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.560
By the way, where's Reiko's

558
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:24.880
wedding?

559
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.320
Of course, she turned it down.

560
00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.100
What?

561
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.640
This?

562
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.980
Yes, the promised Radicon helicopter.

563
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:34.980
I did it!

564
00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.280
So, did the wedding go well?

565
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.180
No, I don't want to get married.

566
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.320
I went to the wedding with my father

567
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:42.960
's face on it.

568
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.380
But I didn't know how to turn

569
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:46.480
him down.

570
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.240
It's all thanks to you, Ryo.

571
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.640
I thought so, too.

572
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.500
This manual is useful, too.

573
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.520
Ryo!

574
00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:58.960
Director!

575
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.440
Good morning!

576
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.960
You're playing with that again while you

577
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.060
're on duty?

578
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.840
No, I'm always on duty.

579
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.160
Look, this isn't a toy.

580
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.720
It's a new type of manual.

581
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.700
Isn't it amazing?

582
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.140
I see.

583
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.940
I understand, so take it off.

584
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.440
Yes, this key is...

585
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:21.680
Huh?

586
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.160
Hurry up and take it off.

587
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.520
D-Director...

588
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.060
What's wrong?

589
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.040
Can't you take it off for a

590
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.580
month?

591
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.340
You bastard!

592
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.040
What are you going to do?

593
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.120
If you stay with the director for a

594
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.720
month, you'll die!

595
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.620
You're really a stubborn person.

596
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.920
Yes, this is Kameya.

597
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.480
I'm busy right now.

598
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.420
What?

599
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.460
An elephant is rampaging in the shopping

600
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:11.560
district?

601
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.100
I can't touch it because it's

602
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.040
dangerous, so please catch it.

603
00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.180
Wait a minute.

604
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.040
Why do I have to go?

605
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.440
Next time, I'll be with the elephant.

606
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.000
I look forward to working with you.

607
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.180
Even if it rains Tomorrow will be sunny

608
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:11.520
Let's wave our hands Let's say

609
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.840
goodbye to things we don't like Let

610
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:23.420

611
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.240
