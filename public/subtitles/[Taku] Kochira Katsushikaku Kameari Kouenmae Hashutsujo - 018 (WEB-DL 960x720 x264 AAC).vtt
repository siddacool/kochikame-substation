00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:23.450
of the changing seasons blows and the brightest

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.230
sun shines Lightly passing through the turb

4
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.830
ulent times I'm a hero, diving

5
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.810
into the city by myself I wanna dive

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.690

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.710
Everybody can do!

10
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.010
The dream I started running always doesn't

11
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.290
stop I won't regret it tomorrow Everybody

12
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.290
can do!

13
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.650
Even if it's just a little bit,

14
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.170
I don't want to see it With

15
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.310
a loud curiosity I jumped high and strong

16
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.990
Gekijya!

17
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:42.890
Kyoto Travel Reenactment You

18
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.100
're the police officer at the police station,

19
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.860
right?

20
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.460
You're so nice, you're so young.

21
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.340
You two are here to make trouble again?

22
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.460
Oh, Ryo-chan, good morning.

23
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.220
Good morning.

24
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.420
I think it's on the driver's

25
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.520
side.

26
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.560
Great, you don't have to answer seriously.

27
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.660
Oh, Ryo-san.

28
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.900
You're going to be in a newspaper

29
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.860
article about traffic lights again.

30
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.360
The other day, when I went to the

31
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.320
main office, my hair was cut off.

32
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.660
I'm going to ask for a little

33
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.280
softer hair from now on.

34
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.520
What are you doing?

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.640
The newspaper we worked so hard to make!

36
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.980
Donkan!

37
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.580
Yabachi!

38
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.400
That's too much, Ryo-san.

39
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.320
No, it's an effective recycle.

40
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.340
Monocell!

41
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720
Bacteria, viruses and the like.

42
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.460
It's the worst!

43
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.860
Shut up!

44
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.600
If you have time to make a newspaper

45
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.620
article with no content, take a legal injection!

46
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.160
You salary thief!

47
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.400

76
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.140
That's lame!

77
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.940
Stop the survey!

78
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.920
Ryo-san!

79
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.300
By the way, the number one man to

81
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.120
san.

82
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.960
The number one man to be hugged

83
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.440
by Onii-san was Terai

84
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.680
-san.

85
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.460
What?

86
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.280
Really?

87
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.760
Damn it!

88
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.060
That's scary!

89
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.400
Let's change the subject.

90
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.600
Let's change the subject.

91
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.460
I'll go to the bathroom.

92
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.320
You guys, remember this.

93
00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.980
Senpai, what are you going to do?

94
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.000
I'll help you with the survey.

95
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.940
Don't make fun of me.

96
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.860
I'll show you everything about me.

97
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.580
Here, there, everywhere.

98
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.720
Here, there, everywhere.

99
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.500
If you do that, you'll be the

100
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.180
worst one, Senpai.

101
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.800
That's right!

102
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.000
You don't know how I feel!

103
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.300
Senpai!

104
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.860
I'll show you everything about me!

105
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.520
Shut up!

106
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.100
What?

107
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.400
Hurry up!

108
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.260
They're coming!

109
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.500
Okay, here I go.

110
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.800
Cheese!

111
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.660
Goddamn!

112
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.660
Don't look down on me!

113
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.580
I don't have to worry about falling

114
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.760
anymore.

115
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.300
I don't have to worry about falling

116
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.400
anymore.

117
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.920
Thank you for your help.

118
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.840
You're welcome.

119
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.660
Is the survey over?

120
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.660
Nakagawa-san, Reiko-

121
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.320
senpai, thank you for coming.

122
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.060
Don't forget the important camera.

123
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.480
That's not ours.

124
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.560
Then whose is it?

125
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.720
Ohara-san, thank you for coming.

126
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.240
Don't tell me...

127
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.800
Oh, that's my camera, Yo-chan.

128
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.620
I forgot it somewhere.

129
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.900
I was looking for it.

130
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.220
Yo-chan, what are you doing?

131
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.640
I'm taking a break.

132
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.020
I'll leave the rest to you, Nak

133
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.740
agawa, Reiko.

134
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.100
It's going to be a long time.

135
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.440
Only five or ten years.

136
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.960
Yo-chan!

137
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.680
Yo-chan, where are you?

138
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.040
Boss, what's wrong?

139
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.420
Yo-chan, where are you going?

140
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.060
I'm going on patrol.

141
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.940
You idiot!

142
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.600
You can go wherever you want.

143
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.040
Don't ever show me your face again.

144
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.380
You're fired.

145
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.840
I don't need a scoundrel

146
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.200
like you.

147
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.220
No, boss.

148
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.040
This is too much...

149
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.720
Are you kidding me, boss?

150
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.880
I'm not kidding.

151
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.940
You're fired.

152
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.420
Oh, no!

153
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.200
Nakagawa, Reiko, please explain.

154
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.260
Bye-bye, Yo-chan.

155
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.700
Nakagawa, Reiko!

156
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.760
How dare you betray me!

157
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.440
You're terrible!

158
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.680
Hey, open the door!

159
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.580
If you don't, I'll break this

160
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.780
door.

161
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.360
What if you make me angry?

162
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.940
This cake Reiko-kun made is

163
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.280
delicious.

164
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.920
If you want it, I have more.

165
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.880
Yo-chan, you've got a lot

166
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.740
of money.

167
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.440
You should give it back.

168
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.600
Wait!

169
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.180
I'll pay you back next time.

170
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.040
If I get fired, I'll get a

171
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.500
bonus.

172
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.060
Nakagawa, Reiko!

173
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.560
Help me!

174
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.760
Oh, here you are, Ryotsu.

175
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.700
That's my camera.

176
00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.740
Give it back.

177
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.520
Boss!

178
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.120
This is a good camera.

179
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.740
It's a Nikon F50.

180
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.500
I wanted one, too.

181
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.720
You're smart.

182
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.940
It's a camera I'm not used

183
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.040
to.

184
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.140
I didn't know how to use it,

185
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.160
so I forgot to bring it with me.

186
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.040
I see.

187
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.860
That's great.

188
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.600
I didn't think you'd forget it

189
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.340
at the police station.

190
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.520
If they find out, we'll be in

191
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.620
trouble.

192
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.820
Will it work?

193
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.180
Give it back to Genzo.

194
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.580
Genzo is a little...

195
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.080
Shut up, Ryotsu.

196
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.120
Boss, you're kidding, right?

197
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.280
I'm not kidding.

198
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.220
You're fired.

199
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.540
Wait a minute.

200
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.240
Where are you going to put it?

201
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.980
I'm going to a camera shop.

202
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.920
No, you can't go there.

203
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.240
You have to pay 20 yen for the

204
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.340
camera.

205
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.580
I don't trust you.

206
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.740
Is there a cheaper shop?

207
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.140
Yes.

208
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.400
I know a 0 yen shop.

209
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.680
Don't lie to me.

210
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.420
You can't do business with 0 yen.

211
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.160
I can.

212
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.460
One 24-frame camera costs 600 yen.

213
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.300
The most expensive one is the one used

214
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.520
for burning.

215
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.680
It's about 30% of 180 yen.

216
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.040
Even if you subtract 40% of the

217
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.660
penalty fee, the remaining 30% is 180

218
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.120
yen.

219
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:20.600
That's the profit.

220
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.180
I understand.

221
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.120
I'm going to give you the picture

222
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.320
tomorrow.

223
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.240
I want it by 10 a.

224
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:28.340
m.

225
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.740
Leave it to me.

226
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.500
I'll be waiting for you by 10

227
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:31.700
a.

228
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:31.880
m.

229
00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.640
It's not that hard to use the

230
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.620
Genzo Color Kit.

231
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.340
I just need to cut where I'm

232
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:44.900
in the picture.

233
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200
I'm sorry.

234
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:49.940
Please take the ball.

235
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.980
What are you doing, kid?

236
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.700
Genzo, you failed.

237
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.420
My face is gone, so it's a

238
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.520
success.

239
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.480
But what are you going to do with

240
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:07.580
the picture of the director?

241
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.460
Did he say Kyoto?

242
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.580
What?

243
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.500
In the next newspaper, he said he was

244
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.260
going to take a picture of the director

245
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.080
's Kyoto trip.

246
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.740
Really?

247
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.020
Yes.

248
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.160
I'll let you go.

249
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.180
I can imagine what he's going to

250
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.280
do.

251
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.640
He took a lot of pictures without people

252
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:29.740
in Kyoto.

253
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.280
I don't remember what he took.

254
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.400
I can fool him with a copy of

255
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.500
the picture.

256
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.640
Will it work?

257
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.960
Don't worry.

258
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.040
I can't fool him.

259
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.880
This is Kameari Park.

260
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.780
Is Ryotsu there?

261
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.820
Yes, sir.

262
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.380
What is it?

263
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.540
Is it Ryotsu?

264
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.140
I forgot to tell you, but I'll

265
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.540
ask you to print it out.

266
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.240
I took a picture with a beautiful girl

267
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.340
from Kyoto.

268
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.240
Did you take a picture with her?

269
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.720
The head of the bonus department took it.

270
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.860
It may be in the newspaper.

271
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.920
It's an important picture.

272
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.700
I'm counting on you, Ryotsu.

273
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.020
Leave it to me.

274
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.580
Am I fired?

275
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.760
You're fired!

276
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.140
I can't fool him with a copy

277
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.240
of the picture.

278
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.440
He's not good at CG.

279
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.520
He'll be defeated soon.

280
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.920
It's your fault!

281
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.600
Do something!

282
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.720
I have nothing to do with it.

283
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.080
It's because you took a picture of

284
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.040
my face.

285
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.180
But he's my senior.

286
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.020
When I'm fired, you'll be fired,

287
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.120
too.

288
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.380
It was a short police officer's life.

289
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.900
I understand.

290
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.440
Head of the bonus department!

291
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360
Let's go to Kyoto.

292
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.420
I'm working.

293
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.260
If you want to get off, do it

294
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.420
yourself.

295
00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:57.660
What is it?

296
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.000
Do you remember the picture I took with

297
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.100
the head of the bonus department?

298
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.960
It was a few days ago.

299
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.960
I want you to reenact it

300
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.060
clearly.

301
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.060
Yes.

302
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.080
What do you think?

303
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.360
I sent all the data about the head

304
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:13.460
of the bonus department.

305
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.200
All we have to do is get the

306
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.420
clothes on the day.

307
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.740
That's it.

308
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.920
I think it's the last line and

309
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.560
the necktie.

310
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:27.920
That's it.

311
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.440
What color is it?

312
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.240
Make it clear!

313
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.780
This color is...

314
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.940
Yes, that's it.

315
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:36.780
Let me go!

316
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.060
The rest is tomorrow.

317
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.500
Our company staff is waiting for you.

318
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.520
I'm sure it'll work out.

319
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.470
We're finally here.

320
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.080
Chief!

321
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.420
Chief!

322
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.720
When did you get here?

323
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.580
Senior.

324
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.280
Yes?

325
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.240
This is a doll I made with the

326
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.260
data I sent from the helicopter.

327
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.800
A doll?

328
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.680
If you're going to be fooled, it

329
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.040
's perfect.

330
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.780
The color is beautiful.

331
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.460
It's well-made.

332
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.520
I don't think it's a doll.

333
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.660
It's made of foam latex.

334
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.800
If you don't see it up close,

335
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.520
you won't be able to see through

336
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:48.720
it.

337
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.680
This face.

338
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.080
When the chief stands in front of the

339
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.360
camera, he gets nervous and makes this face.

340
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.980
But...

341
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.420
Why did you make something like this?

342
00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.360
Don't ask unnecessary questions!

343
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.420
But...

344
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.800
I've prepared the doll.

345
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:03.820
Senior.

346
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.520
The staff who will help us with the

347
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.460
shooting is here.

348
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.480
Okay.

349
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.020
Let's go!

350
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.260
Is this everyone?

351
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.540
Yes.

352
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.260
Chief!

353
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.480
I thought it was this maid.

354
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.880
Welcome.

355
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.140
It's been a week, sir.

356
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.720
Oh, that time.

357
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.920
All right, all the actors are here.

358
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.720
Start shooting!

359
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.680
How is it?

360
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.320
It's like a ray of light.

361
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.320
All right.

362
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:05.740
Please shoot.

363
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.240
I'll take it.

364
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.700
Next is Kamogawa.

365
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.140
Recently, our special effects staff...

366
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.340
I'm participating in the super-me

367
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:21.740
asurement of drawings at Computer

368
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.360
Graphics.

369
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.480
Is it a movie called Tornado

370
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:26.580
of Dinosaurs?

371
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.320
Yes.

372
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.720
Well, let's take a look at this

373
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:29.820
picture.

374
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.580
I think we can go home in the

375
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.900
evening.

376
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

377
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.440
Enjoy your meal.

378
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:36.840
Please eat.

379
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.660
I thought it was a movie.

380
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:39.980
It's amazing that there's even a

381
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.600
dining car.

382
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.140
It's common in American movies.

383
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.080
This is delicious!

384
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.200
Yes.

385
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.200
He used to work as a general manager

386
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.520
at Sheraton in Hong Kong.

387
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.060
I pulled him out.

388
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.680
Where should I put the chief?

389
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.960
Chief Ohara took a picture of a

390
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.060
duck.

391
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.500
He won't go into the river.

392
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.240
Hurry up and say that!

393
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.560
There's no chief!

394
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.500
I think the duck is about to fly.

395
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.240
It's a duck!

396
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.180
Let the duck fly!

397
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.120
Yes!

398
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.200
What's wrong?

399
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.800
I think he's diving.

400
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.800
Hey, he's diving!

401
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.820
I think it's a parrot.

402
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.660
It's a parrot!

403
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:25.900
It's a duck!

404
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.520
It's impossible.

405
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.140
I don't think it's a duck.

406
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.020
Stop it!

407
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.060
Don't you remember clearly?

408
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.140
If you blame me so much, I can

409
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:39.560
't remember what I remember.

410
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.000
It's a carp!

411
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.600
It's a carp!

412
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.960
There are three carps.

413
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.840
There's no mistake.

414
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:45.840
It's a carp!

415
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.440
Prepare a carp!

416
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.080
Yes, it's okay.

417
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.500
All right, let the waves roll!

418
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:16.940
It's a wind!

419
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.120
The chief is flying!

420
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.300
All right, one more picture.

421
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.300
It's easy.

422
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.640
Excuse me.

423
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.660
Don't dawdle.

424
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.960
Hurry up and push the shutter.

425
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.840
At that time, the cherry blossoms behind were

426
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.340
in full bloom.

427
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.940
Make the cherry blossoms in full bloom!

428
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.520
Yes, sir!

429
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.079
And there were about 50 tourist

430
00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:06.179
s.

431
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.220
50 tourists!

432
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.040
Yes, sir!

433
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.829
And it was a sunset sky

434
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.929
as far as I could see.

435
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.710
You idiot!

436
00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:20.550
Don't talk to me when it's

437
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:20.650
dark!

438
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:21.310
Excuse me.

439
00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:22.470
Can you see the sunset?

440
00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.450
I don't think it's possible in

441
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:25.550
this darkness.

442
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.550
Let's do something.

443
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.860
This is it!

444
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.580
This is the sunset of that day!

445
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.640
Hurry up and turn off the shutter!

446
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.320
Yes, sir!

447
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.440
Somehow, it ended safely.

448
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.380
Yes.

449
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.280
You did a good job, too.

450
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.140
Good job!

451
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.440
You don't have to kick anything off.

452
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:09.680
Shut up!

453
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:10.980
Even though it's a doll, it's

454
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.980
creepy to think that there are two chief

455
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.080
Ohara.

456
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.860
Line 12.

457
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:15.720
At 9.

458
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.860
34 p.

459
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.040
m.

460
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.420
Tokyo Station, Nozomi 304.

461
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.740
Somehow, we made it to the last Sh

462
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.140
inkansen.

463
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.220
Now, we'll arrive at Tokyo Station before

464
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.320
12 o'clock.

465
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.840
When we get home, we'll give it

466
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:25.940
to you.

467
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.680
It's a piece of cake.

468
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.760
What is it?

469
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.620
There was another picture.

470
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.400
What?

471
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.060
I forgot the most important Buddha statue picture.

472
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:38.820
Wait a minute!

473
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.980
Yes, yes.

474
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:43.780
I understand.

475
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:44.900
No.

476
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.840
The movie staff just left for Alaska.

477
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.760
Then, what about the helicopter?

478
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.200
The engine broke down.

479
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:51.840
It's in Nagoya.

480
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.160
It won't be able to fly for

481
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.800
two or three hours.

482
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:55.860
Damn it!

483
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:56.720
I guess I have no choice but to

484
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.120
take it by myself.

485
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.120
Senpai!

486
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.040
Did you find it?

487
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.680
How long are you going to make me

488
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.020
suffer?

489
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.920
Senpai!

490
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.800
Did you find it?

491
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.330
Hey!

492
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.090
This Buddha statue looks very similar.

493
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.990
It's not just any Buddha statue.

494
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:31.350
It's a super-luxury

495
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.450
Buddha statue that has been shown to the

496
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.410
public once every 1,000 years for only

497
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.050
three minutes.

498
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:37.530
Show me the Buddha statue!

499
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.010
What are you doing at this late hour?

500
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:40.970
Show me this Buddha statue!

501
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.370
This has only been shown once every 1,

502
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.470
000 years.

503
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.590
I can't hear you!

504
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.390
I told you not to say that!

505
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.030
Are you all right?

506
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.490
Damn it!

507
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.350
Damn it!

508
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.850
I'm going to bury you alive!

509
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500
Senpai.

510
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.720
I don't think this is a good

511
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:10.880
idea.

512
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.140
This is an illegal intrusion.

513
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.860
Who are you calling an illegal intruder?

514
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:15.120
Senpai!

515
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.220
Who are you?

516
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:16.920
What are you doing here?

517
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.440
Senpai!

518
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.180
I'm sorry.

519
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.620
Just get out of here!

520
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.290
It's impossible to guard this place.

521
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.110
Are you telling me to give up?

522
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:45.390
No.

523
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.290
But the next time I see it, it

524
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.050
'll be 1,000 years from now.

525
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.550
Have you come up with a good idea?

526
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:52.790
Huh?

527
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.710
I see.

528
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.270
You have a plan.

529
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.530
Yes.

530
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:56.890
What is it?

531
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.400
Damn it!

532
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.300
Why do I have to do this?

533
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.980
Why do I have to do this?

534
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.220
Wow!

535
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.500
You look just like him, Senpai!

536
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.420
Do I?

537
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.780
I don't have time!

538
00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.880
Now, which way is it?

539
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.920
First, turn around, twist your body, and look

540
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.500
this way.

541
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.280
Like this?

542
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.400
Yes.

543
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.760
The right arm is behind your neck, to

544
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.120
your left cheek, and your fingers are in

545
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.420
your mouth.

546
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.420
Like this?

547
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.380
If you look closely, you can see that

548
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.560
only one of your toes is standing up.

549
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.700
What?

550
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.800
The left arm is facing your nose, The

551
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.300
right eye is facing north, and the left

552
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.000
eye is facing south.

553
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.960
Hurry up and get it!

554
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.040
I'll get it.

555
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.640
What are you doing?

556
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.600
Ryo-chan isn't coming back.

557
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:26.880
That's right.

558
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.680
Ryo, is Ryo here?

559
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.860
That's...

560
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:32.820
What?

561
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.160
Did you get the wrong camera?

562
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.420
That's right.

563
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.920
I put in the film, but I forgot

564
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.020
to put this in before I left because

565
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.360
the camera was too heavy.

566
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.920
Is that so?

567
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.100
Bujo!

568
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.100
I did it!

569
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:48.420
I did it!

570
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.720
Bujo, I took the picture.

571
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.380
Are you Ryo?

572
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.400
Ryo-chan?

573
00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.660
What are you wearing?

574
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.280
Look at this.

575
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.600
It's Bujo's picture.

576
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:02.760
Picture?

577
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.100
This is...

578
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.160
There are two legs.

579
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.740
What's that?

580
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.360
The pose and everything else is exactly the

581
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:14.460
same.

582
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.300
But the details are a little different.

583
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.660
What do you mean?

584
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.260
You're up to something again, aren't

585
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:21.380
you, Ryo?

586
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.640
No, I'm not, Bujo!

587
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.000
I did it!

588
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.040
I got the picture!

589
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.080
I'm looking forward to the next auction.

590
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.800
Damn you!

591
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.000
Wait!

592
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.440
Let's hear what you have to say,

593
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.420
Ryo.

594
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.220
Bujo, wait!

595
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.300
There's a deep reason for this!

596
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.550
What is it?

597
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.800
I'm Chouhoro Oma

598
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.240
eda, a gourmet critic.

599
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.920
I've been to a lot of r

600
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.440
estaurants because of this guy.

601
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.820
I hate people who hate food.

602
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.420
I'll be your next opponent.

603
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.520
Come at me!

604
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.440
Next time, on Soba Ya!

605
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.480
Don't miss it!

606
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.050
Soba Ya!

607
00:24:37.050 --> 00:25:07.030
Sub

608
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:07.130
bed by Dreadopp and Zed

609
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.230
opp.

610
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.610
Let's shake hands.

611
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.770
Let's say goodbye to all the bad

612
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.870
things.

613
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.850
Let's try to live the way we

614
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:20.950
like.

615
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.550
There are good things.

616
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.250
Outside the door, a lullaby is

617
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:29.830
calling.
