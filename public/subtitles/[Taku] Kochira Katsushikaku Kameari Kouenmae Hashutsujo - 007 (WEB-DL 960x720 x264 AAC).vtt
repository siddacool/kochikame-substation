00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.090
lecture.

3
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.390
Last year, there was a heat wave.

4
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.030
Geta, geta, geta, geta,

5
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.190
geta-sa!

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.150
It came to Okinawa, and the

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.290
salt water was burning.

8
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.410
It was the south wind.

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.990
It came to Okinawa, and the

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.190
salt water was burning.

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.630
It was the south wind.

12
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.190
Ah, this year, there was a heat wave.

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.850
Geta, geta, geta, geta,

14
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.470
geta-sa!

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.770
Ah, the summer of this year has come

16
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.190
It's here, it's here, it's

17
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.430
here, it's here A big wave, a

18
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.870
small wave, a small wave, a

19
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.850
small wave Riding on the

20
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.750
south wind A big butt, a small butt,

21
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.870
a small butt, a small butt In Nag

22
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:10.330
isa Riding on the south wind In

23
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.300
Nagisa Riding on the south wind

24
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.480
In Nagisa Riding on the south

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:30.400
wind Wake up,

26
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.140
Inspector Tomin!

27
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.280
The fireflies that were burning in the

28
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.760
sky of Atlanta are now quietly trying to

29
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.860
disappear.

30
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.460
We'll see you again in four years

31
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.560
at the next festival.

32
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.720
The Olympics ended in a blink of an

33
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.820
eye.

34
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.640
But there's something missing.

35
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.960
Something missing?

36
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.320
The number of medals?

37
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.400
That's not it.

38
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.120
When you think of the Olympics, there's

39
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.140
always something missing.

40
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.300
The Olympics?

41
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.360
The spring and summer of the Tokyo Olympics

42
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.500
were great, weren't they?

43
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.460
No.

44
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.600
There are things that have a stronger impact.

45
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.220
Ah, the one where a woman puts powder

46
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.620
on her face.

47
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.660
That's a compact.

48
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.920
It's coming out of my throat, but

49
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.460
I can't remember.

50
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.800
Huh?

51
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.900
Huh?

52
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.680
That's right, it's a cicada.

53
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.400
It has something to do with cicadas.

54
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.660
Cicadas?

55
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.040
The one that's crying right now is

56
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.920
an oil cicada, isn't it?

57
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.440
It's not an oil cicada.

58
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.980
Then, is it Tsukutsuku H

59
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.160
oshi?

60
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.560
Huh?

61
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.500
You're getting close.

62
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
Was there anything else?

63
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.640
Ah, the one that cries when it hears

64
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.740
a bell.

65
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.740
Huh?

66
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.500
Is it a stupid cicada that can

67
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.600
't cry when it hears kanji?

68
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.580
That's not it.

69
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.180
Um, it's Higurashi.

70
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.100
Huh?

71
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.720
Higurashi!

72
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.740
I see.

73
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.100
You forgot about him.

74
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.040
That's impossible.

75
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.640
It's the same as the Olympics.

76
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.540
It only happens once every four years.

77
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.680
Has it been four years since then?

78
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.220
What are you talking about?

79
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.420
Other than us, Higurashi is

80
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.920
on duty at this police station.

81
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.440
Huh?

82
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.040
I don't know anyone like that.

83
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.540
Me neither.

84
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.800
It's only recent that you guys started

85
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.300
working here, so how could you not know?

86
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.180
That's right.

87
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.500
I think the last time he was on

88
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.820
duty was four years ago at the Barcelona

89
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.240
Olympics.

90
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.600
So, he's been on duty for four

91
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.940
years?

92
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.440
Higurashi is a man of

93
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.800
few words.

94
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.140
Ever since he joined, he's been on

95
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.260
leave.

96
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.200
He only goes on duty for three days

97
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.780
a month.

98
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.640
Then, it gradually escalated, and now he

99
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.160
only comes here once every four years.

100
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.820
Once every four years?

101
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.500
Yes.

102
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.840
That's why he's called the O

103
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840
lympic Man.

104
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.560
I can't believe it.

105
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.780
I can't believe there's a man

106
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.440
who's worse than Ryo-chan.

107
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.840
I'm glad I didn't get fired.

108
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.840
Higurashi has a special ability.

109
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.820
A special ability?

110
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.640
You'll see when you bring him here.

111
00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.180
What?

112
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.000
I'll pass.

113
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.200
You're the only one who knows H

114
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.600
igurashi.

115
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.420
Hurry up and tell me!

116
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.740
Hurry up!

117
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.140
Sorry to keep you waiting.

118
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.280
Oh, yes.

119
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.360
What?

120
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.089
Senpai, I was just going to wake

121
00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.390
you up.

122
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.670
Why do you need such heavy equipment?

123
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.470
You'll know when you get there.

124
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.580
Does Higurashi-san live

125
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.880
in the same dorm as you?

126
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.540
Does Higurashi-san live

127
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.640
in the same dorm as you?

128
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.560
I think it was this room.

129
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.510
Senpai, this isn't a storage room.

130
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.690
Idiot, this isn't a storage room.

131
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.630
This is where people live.

132
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.930
Here it is.

133
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.650
It's still rusty.

134
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.350
Nakano, open the door.

135
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.470
Yes.

136
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.090
Huh?

137
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.980
Get out of the way, Nakano!

138
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.360
Hey, Higurashi!

139
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.080
Are you there?

140
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.750
This isn't a place for humans to

141
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.210
live.

142
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.210
I've been left alone for four years

143
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.650
without doing anything.

144
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.910
But it's so dark, I can't

145
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.190
see anything.

146
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.590
Nakano, open the window.

147
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.270
Y-Yes.

148
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.200
Ow, ow, ow!

149
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.780
There's something stuck to my face!

150
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.360
A spider web?

151
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.580
What are you doing?

152
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.440
Are you afraid of spiders?

153
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:31.280
A swarm of bats...

154
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.360
It's so bright.

155
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.700
Give me my sunglasses.

156
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.560
You're such a troublemaker.

157
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.620
Nakano, lend it to him.

158
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.500
Here you go.

159
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.040
You saved me.

160
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.720
Every time he wakes up, he reacts like

161
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.160
a Dracula.

162
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.420
Is that voice Ryotsu?

163
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.780
That's right.

164
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.060
I came to pick you up.

165
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.500
What?

166
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.520
It's still summer in Heisei

167
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.680
4?

168
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.880
No, I slept a little, so it's

169
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.180
not autumn?

170
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.340
It's been a long time.

171
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.020
This year is Heisei 8.

172
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.940
That's stupid.

173
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.280
Then what happened to the Japanese New

174
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.960
spaper that was in a boom?

175
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.560
That newspaper is long gone.

176
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.140
What?

177
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.340
Then what about the Jimin Newspaper

178
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.480
that was in a boom?

179
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.600
That's true, but a part of it

180
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.740
went out and made a new newspaper.

181
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.100
Then, isn't the prime minister Miyaz

182
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.260
awa?

183
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.380
Miyazawa?

184
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.000
Now that you mention it, it was like

185
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.580
that four years ago.

186
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.800
That's right.

187
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.820
While you were sleeping, Hosokawa-

188
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.120
san, Hada-san, Murayama

189
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.660
-san changed.

190
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.200
Now it's Hashimoto-san.

191
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.500
Has it changed that much?

192
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.160
The governor is also from Aoshima.

193
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.100
You can't beat me.

194
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.680
Anyway, the governor of Osaka is going to

195
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.520
say Yokoyama Knock.

196
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.140
Wow, ping-pong!

197
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.300
You got it well.

198
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.760
Is that true?

199
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.800
Then what happened to Wakahanada

200
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.580
and Takahanada?

201
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.660
Then, Wakahanada and Takahanada

202
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.100
changed their names, and the older brother became

203
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.740
Ozeki, and the younger brother became

204
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.320
Yokozuna.

205
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.120
Has the world changed that much?

206
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.340
It's like Taro Urashima.

207
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.080
Ryo-tsu, who is that

208
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.640
young man?

209
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.820
He's Nakagawa, who's been

210
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.280
the number one in the police station since

211
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:09.380
this year.

212
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.600
Anyway, don't sleep forever and get up

213
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:12.860
quickly!

214
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.160
Get up!

215
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.320
Don't make such a loud voice.

216
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.000
It's going to ring in your stomach.

217
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.840
First of all, I'm hungry.

218
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.200
I can't do it.

219
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:26.660
I can't do it.

220
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.960
Please open the door.

221
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.960
This storeroom is broken.

222
00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.120
Is the rice ball and bread you bought

223
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.440
when you were sleeping useless?

224
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.840
Yes, it's out of order.

225
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.360
What about the milk?

226
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.000
Of course it's useless.

227
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.220
Oh, it's heavy.

228
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:42.799
What?

229
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.800
It's cheese.

230
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:45.940
Lucky.

231
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.900
This is fine.

232
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.820
How about you?

233
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.940
I'm fine.

234
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.020
You're a shy guy.

235
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.060
Then I'll watch TV until I'm

236
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.160
done eating.

237
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.800
It's good to watch while you're

238
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:04.900
sleeping.

239
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.920
Next, hurry up and open the door.

240
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.180
Ryo-tsu, I'm sorry,

241
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.360
but take me to the bathroom.

242
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.620
Where is the bathroom in this room?

243
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.000
The washing machine is the bathroom?

244
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.780
You take the sheets and pillowcase.

245
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.860
I'll wash it with you.

246
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.120
Yes.

247
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.000
By the way, turn the switch upside

248
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.100
down.

249
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.300
This switch is the best.

250
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.980
It feels good.

251
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.100
It's the best place in the world.

252
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.740
Change into this.

253
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.460
I'm sorry, but please spread it out.

254
00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.500
It takes a lot of time.

255
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.830
Are you okay?

256
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.010
Yes.

257
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.770
Anyway, I'm tired.

258
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.250
I might not be able to sleep.

259
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.890
You're sleeping too much.

260
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.490
Is that so?

261
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.090
Oh, this way.

262
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:19.630
I'm sorry.

263
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.350
Are you okay?

264
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.010
When did you build the stairs here?

265
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.530
It's been here for a long time.

266
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.530
Have you forgotten?

267
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.530
Come to think of it, it looks like

268
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.590
it fell four years ago.

269
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.070
It fell eight years ago and twelve years

270
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.230
ago.

271
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.050
It's a rule, isn't it?

272
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.610
What is it?

273
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.270
Didn't you come by police car?

274
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.730
It's a 15-minute walk.

275
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.590
Let's go.

276
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.130
It's a hassle.

277
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.410
Let's go by my car.

278
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.870
Did you have a car?

279
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:08.110
It's a new car.

280
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.590
No, I bought it 20 years ago.

281
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.090
I've only been on it twice, so

282
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.650
it's a new car.

283
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.010
Twice in 20 years?

284
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.010
Isn't a taxi better?

285
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.330
It's a hassle to pick it up.

286
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.740
The meter has only run three kilometers yet.

287
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.220
It's scary to go out.

288
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.240
I've never been out of town.

289
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.020
Well, let's go.

290
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.300
Oh, the engine's on.

291
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760
Well, what's next?

292
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.580
Step on the clutch and put the shift

293
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.320
lever in low.

294
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.300
Oh, that's right.

295
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.200
Well, the clutch is...

296
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.020
Oh!

297
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.750
I can't believe you turned a new

298
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.250
car into a car in three seconds.

299
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.150
That's amazing.

300
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.070
But I'm awake now.

301
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.880
Chief, I brought him.

302
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.920
Oh, thank you.

303
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.680
I'm tired of walking after a long

304
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:22.780
time.

305
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.600
I'm going to sleep.

306
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.640
He's still the same.

307
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.120
He's still the same as four years

308
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.280
ago.

309
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.980
He's really a busybody.

310
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.440
Hey, wake up, Higurashi.

311
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.660
Yes, yes, I'm awake.

312
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.480
At least say hello to the chief.

313
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.200
Chief, it's been a long time.

314
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.860
You're still the chief of police?

315
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.580
Thank you very much.

316
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.140
This is Terai, who was appointed three

317
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.040
years ago.

318
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.420
Hello, I'm Higurashi.

319
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:51.860
Nice to meet you.

320
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720
I'm a fan of Risa Miy

321
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.060
azawa.

322
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.780
I bought a very popular photo album called

323
00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.440
Yontafe the other day.

324
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.940
Let's look at it together next time.

325
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.420
Oh, yes.

326
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.520
There's no one else who's going

327
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.180
to talk about such a photo album.

328
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.080
Next is...

329
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.360
I'm back.

330
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.620
Oh, Reiko, let me introduce you.

331
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.920
Oh, this is the rumored...

332
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.180
Bokiboki!

333
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.400
Hello, I'm Higurashi.

334
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.180
People call me Son Higurashi.

335
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.300
Nice to meet you.

336
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.360
I'm Reiko Akimoto.

337
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.340
Yes, Higurashi is fully awake.

338
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.560
Because I'm weak against women.

339
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.460
I feel it.

340
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.420
What's this feeling?

341
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.140
The incident is calling me.

342
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.160
What's going on?

343
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.400
It's time for Higurashi

344
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:52.960
to show his true colors.

345
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.680
Terai, bring me the unsolved case

346
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:55.940
file.

347
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.940
Yes, sir.

348
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.290
At first, he was an unknown man.

349
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.100
I saw it.

350
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.520
This man works at a construction site in

351
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:15.620
Yamagata City in the northeast.

352
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.320
Terai, contact the head office immediately.

353
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.860
Yes, sir.

354
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.980
This is Higurashi, who appeared

355
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.440
in front of the Kameyari

356
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:22.780
Park.

357
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.180
The second case is a jewelry thief.

358
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.700
The culprit is hiding in a mansion in

359
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.040
Sumida River, called Nakayama.

360
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.880
Yamada of the Intercontinental

361
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.020
Law Enforcement Team is lurking in

362
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.580
an apartment in Fukagawa.

363
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.820
Next, the continuation of the marriage fraud team

364
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.240
is lurking in Asakusa Kam

365
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.560
inarimon.

366
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.460
That's amazing.

367
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.000
It's a surveillance ability.

368
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.100
That's right.

369
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.180
Higurashi solves unsolved cases

370
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.920
like this every time he wakes up.

371
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.260
Next!

372
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.160
Next!

373
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.160
Next!

374
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.120
Next!

375
00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.100
Next!

376
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.520
Oh, I'm tired and sleepy.

377
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.200
You idiot!

378
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.240
You haven't worked for four years yet!

379
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.100
Reiko, give him a shoulder rub.

380
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:11.860
What?

381
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.100
Thank you for your hard work.

382
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.880
Thank you for your hard work.

383
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.800
Mr. Higurashi, you have a

384
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.480
great ability.

385
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.360
All right!

386
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.380
Ryotsu, the camera!

387
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.640
All right!

388
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.020
I can see it!

389
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.240
I can see it!

390
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.480
What are you doing?

391
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.680
It's a camera.

392
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.240
Higurashi can now show a

393
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.020
case that happens within 24 hours.

394
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.360
You can do that?

395
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.120
All right!

396
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:56.480
I wonder what's in the picture.

397
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.760
It's a undergarment thief!

398
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.280
There have been a lot of casualties in

399
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:04.380
the ship lately.

400
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.080
But I don't know who the culprit

401
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.920
is in this picture.

402
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.060
It's a pretty smart guy to blur

403
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.160
and become a shadow.

404
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.900
Then, in this picture...

405
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.720
Deya!

406
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.880
Deya!

407
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.620
Deya!

408
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.340
It's amazing that there are four pictures

409
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.360
in a row.

410
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.360
He's getting better at his skills every

411
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:31.460
year.

412
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.340
Huh?

413
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.660
Isn't that a dog?

414
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.600
It's a dog that barks a

415
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:40.700
lot during patrols.

416
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.780
All right!

417
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.220
Let's go!

418
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.220
Yes!

419
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.300
This house...

420
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.180
What is it?

421
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.060
It's the house with the most under

422
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.960
garment thefts.

423
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.660
It's like living in Tokyo University.

424
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.880
The owner of this house is a woman

425
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.140
called Amura.

426
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.300
Amura?

427
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.520
What's that?

428
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.099
Amura is a fashion fan of the

429
00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.180
top idol Amuro.

430
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.060
What?

431
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.980
Isn't the top idol Risa Miy

432
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.260
azawa?

433
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.680
Risa has lost weight and is on

434
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:19.920
a diet.

435
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.240
No way...

436
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.540
Don't be depressed, Higurashi.

437
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.460
Let's go.

438
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.220
Why is our Taku-chan the

439
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:32.520
culprit?

440
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.160
You guys can't arrest the culprit, so

441
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.640
you're giving us a clue.

442
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.080
What?

443
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.630
What is this?

444
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.650
Higurashi also has a mental

445
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:52.950
power.

446
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.620
It's a hole.

447
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.080
It's a stolen undergarment.

448
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.080
No way...

449
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.820
Higurashi, you did it.

450
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.400
I can still feel it.

451
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.480
There's a camera inside.

452
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.400
Yes.

453
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.440
This time it's a bank robbery.

454
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.640
I remember this bank.

455
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.900
It's a bank in front of the

456
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.000
station.

457
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:25.780
Look.

458
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.040
The clock is also reflected.

459
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.260
35 minutes ago.

460
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.520
There are only 10 minutes left.

461
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:31.700
I don't know.

462
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.140
Reiko, we'll go straight to the

463
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:35.240
bank.

464
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.520
I'll leave this to you.

465
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:37.960
Roger.

466
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.720
Hurry, Nakazawa.

467
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.300
Yes.

468
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.260
Everyone, raise your hands.

469
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.580
Give me the money.

470
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.580
Welcome.

471
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.920
It's a gorilla.

472
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.500
What's a gorilla?

473
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.360
It's a gorilla.

474
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:15.760
You bastard.

475
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.600
Senpai.

476
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.080
Damn it.

477
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:24.820
You're in my way.

478
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.320
I'll kill you.

479
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.220
What?

480
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.320
Now.

481
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.160
It's a bank.

482
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.020
Higurashi, put on the bank.

483
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.400
It's time to run away.

484
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.540
Let's go.

485
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:44.950
Everyone did well.

486
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.710
But Mr. Higurashi has a

487
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:48.810
really amazing ability.

488
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.870
I know why I didn't get fired.

489
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.530
What happened to Higurashi?

490
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.850
He was here until now.

491
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:58.750
I'm tired.

492
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.650
I can't do it anymore.

493
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.610
If you can't do all the races,

494
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.830
just do the main race.

495
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.470
Tell me which one is the best.

496
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.370
What are you doing, Ryosuke?

497
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.290
Chief.

498
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.270
I was going to ask Mr. Hig

499
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.910
urashi to solve another case.

500
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.970
There are many cases.

501
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.730
Did you hear that?

502
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.450
I feel it.

503
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:31.490
I feel it.

504
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:32.590
Which one is the best?

505
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.410
Which one is the best?

506
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.310
You idiot.

507
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.090
I knew it.

508
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.550
What?

509
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.740
What?

510
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.380
I was being pulled by a truck.

511
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.100
This is definitely Ryotsu.

512
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.420
It's an ominous picture.

513
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.500
Hey, Higurashi.

514
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.560
Why did you take this picture?

515
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.260
I don't know.

516
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.400
I just took it.

517
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.300
It's not a sudden death.

518
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.520
You might be saved by a traffic jam.

519
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.640
I didn't follow him.

520
00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.480
I was being pulled by a truck.

521
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.020
Ryotsu.

522
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:14.980
Don't worry.

523
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.080
Don't worry.

524
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.460
There is a mistake.

525
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.460
My ability is perfect.

526
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:18.960
I have confidence.

527
00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:19.900
But I'm afraid I'm going to

528
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.000
lose a few hundred million yen.

529
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.680
Are you encouraging me?

530
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.580
Are you bragging?

531
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.480
Which one is it?

532
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.340
I will never believe it.

533
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.920
You look pale.

534
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.300
I'm not kidding.

535
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.680
Higurashi.

536
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.280
As far as I can see the picture,

537
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:35.760
it's outside.

538
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:36.760
I'm relieved if I don't go

539
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.400
out for 24 hours.

540
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.440
Shut up.

541
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.700
I'm afraid of the traffic

542
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:40.800
jam.

543
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.040
Can you do it?

544
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.180
Can you do it?

545
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.820
I will never believe it.

546
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.000
Senpai.

547
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.760
Ryotsu.

548
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.340
Don't do it.

549
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.180
Shut up.

550
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.280
Don't worry about me.

551
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.340
I told you it's dangerous to go

552
00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:52.440
out.

553
00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.500
Senpai.

554
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.520
Ryotsu.

555
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.080
Are you okay?

556
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.900
It hurts.

557
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.120
It hurts.

558
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.140
In other words, this picture is the moment

559
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.520
when you hit the truck that stopped by

560
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:10.620
yourself.

561
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.680
Hey, Higurashi.

562
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.340
You should sleep for a million years.

563
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.340
Don't wake up anymore.

564
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.640
You idiot.

565
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.640
I'll do that.

566
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:22.880
Before that, boss.

567
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.220
It's the usual ritual.

568
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.360
Reiko.

569
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.780
10 Tenzon.

570
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:28.900
10 Unadon.

571
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.220
20 Yakiniku.

572
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.880
10 Sushi.

573
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.700
Order 10 servings.

574
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:33.920
What?

575
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.200
Here you are.

576
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.560
Take them to the back room.

577
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.380
Yes.

578
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.020
You have a great appetite.

579
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.120
I've been sleeping for four years, so

580
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:00.380
I'm eating.

581
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.980
It's like a bear before it goes

582
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.080
into hibernation.

583
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.320
Stop it.

584
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.780
But...

585
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.130
How can you be so fat?

586
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.390
It's like a different person.

587
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.490
Well, see you in four years.

588
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.390
Shut up.

589
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:28.810
Go home and sleep.

590
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:30.910
See you.

591
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.870
See you tomorrow.

592
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:34.410
Good night.

593
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.610
When we meet next time, it will be

594
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.670
the 2000th anniversary.

595
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.930
I can't wait for the next Olympics.

596
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:40.850
I'm not kidding.

597
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.050
I'll be the one who's going

598
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:43.150
to wake you up.

599
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:44.990
That's a good idea.

600
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.180
Do you know the Kachidoki

601
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.380
Bridge?

602
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.980
When a big ship comes, the bridge breaks

603
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.100
in half and goes up.

604
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.200
Unfortunately, it's not open now.

605
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.300
But this Kachidoki Bridge has

606
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.340
memories of my childhood.

607
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.440
Next time, on Kachidoki Bridge,

608
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.620
I'm looking forward to it.
