(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Summer has come again this year.

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Summer has come again this year.

3
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.820
A big wave is coming.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.300
It's a big deal.

5
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.960
A big chest is coming.

6
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.360
It's a big deal.

7
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.900
Summer has come again this year.

8
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.780
Summer has come again this year.

9
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.500
A big wave is coming.

10
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.280
It's a big deal.

11
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.500
A big butt is coming.

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.920
It's a big deal.

13
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.300
Kachidoki Bridge, open!

14
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.440
Let's go!

15
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.980
It was a wonderful wedding.

16
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.820
Yeah.

17
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.620
Cheers!

18
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.500
Hey, we came all the way to Gin

19
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.940
za.

20
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.680
Let's go home after seeing the K

21
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.260
achidoki Bridge.

22
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.460
But the direction is the opposite.

23
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.300
What?

24
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.500
If you're going to complain...

25
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.200
I understand!

26
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.360
It's Ryo-chan.

27
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.990
Let's go.

28
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.190
Ryo-chan, we're here.

29
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.930
Get up.

30
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.690
I told you to go by yourself.

31
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.390
Kei-chan, stop!

32
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.250
What is it?

33
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.150
There's a man on the bridge.

34
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.170
What?

35
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.010
He's not a ghost, is he?

36
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.410
Where is he, Reiko-san?

37
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.190
I think he's on the bridge.

38
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.370
Are you sure you saw him?

39
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.550
No, I'm sure I saw him.

40
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.610
He looked like he was about to jump

41
00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.950
off.

42
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.160
It was a wonderful wedding.

43
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.840
There was a tea party this morning.

44
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.080
I'm in a really good mood.

45
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.900
Is that so?

46
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.480
Thank you for your help.

47
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.660
It seems that there were no incidents or

48
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.580
accidents near the Kachidoki Bridge.

49
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.920
The Kachidoki Bridge?

50
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.320
But why was there a man on the

51
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.540
bridge?

52
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.960
Good morning.

53
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.340
Ryo-chan.

54
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.140
Senpai, you're in luck.

55
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.480
The chief was in a really good mood

56
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.580
this morning.

57
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.140
Lucky.

58
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.800
Good morning.

59
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.500
I drank a little too much.

60
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.620
You idiot!

61
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.820
What do you think you're doing?

62
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.020
Please don't yell at me.

63
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.580
My head hurts.

64
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.940
Come here.

65
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.960
I'll give you a lot.

66
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.100
I'm not a stray cat.

67
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.380
Hey, where are you in a good mood?

68
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.920
Let's get out of here.

69
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.980
I wonder what happened.

70
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.840
He was in such a good mood.

71
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.360
Idiot!

72
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.950
Illegal parking.

73
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.970
Good morning.

74
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.250
Oh, it's Sapporo Namba.

75
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.410
Yes.

76
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.990
I've been parking illegally near the K

77
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.050
achidoki Bridge since last night.

78
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.130
Kachidoki Bridge since last night?

79
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.810
Yes.

80
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.790
A neighbor saw a tall man in white

81
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.250
get off the bridge.

82
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.130
White clothes?

83
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.070
Could it be last night?

84
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.490
Hello.

85
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.290
Please introduce me to the owner of the

86
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.390
car.

87
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.570
The number is Sapporo.

88
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.130
It's not just a parking violation, is

89
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.230
it?

90
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.930
Is it an incident?

91
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.670
No, it's not decided that it's

92
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.010
a car from last night.

93
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.230
Yes.

94
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.610
Sapporo City, Toyohiya Ward.

95
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.330
Yes.

96
00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.330
Shiratori.

97
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.990
Shiratori, white bird, pure pure, Shiratori

98
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.210
Jun.

99
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.750
Thank you very much.

100
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.910
What happened to Shiratori Jun?

101
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.430
Yes.

102
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.970
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

103
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.530
Do you know him, Byou-chan?

104
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.190
Yes.

105
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.670
He's a friend from my junior high

106
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.510
school days.

107
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.350
But I guess it was only for a

108
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.930
short time.

109
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.670
He left his car near the Kach

110
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.910
idoki Bridge and disappeared somewhere.

111
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.090
Kachidoki Bridge?

112
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.130
Oh, I see.

113
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.110
He came to see the bridge.

114
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.650
The bridge?

115
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.850
What do you mean?

116
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.010
Is that so, Senpai?

117
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.890
Yeah.

118
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.750
That was when I was a cute middle

119
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.330
school student.

120
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.250
Yo, Tsukankichi!

121
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.790
Yes!

122
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.330
Big Spinning Midair Kick!

123
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.330
My eyes are spinning!

124
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.050
Kankichi!

125
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.870
Who told you to spin midair?

126
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.490
It's on the house!

127
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.750
Kankichi, you're amazing!

128
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.550
You're the best!

129
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.190
Jun, did you have fun?

130
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.930
Next time, I'll show you something more

131
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.290
flashy!

132
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.270
Kankichi!

133
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.350
Yes!

134
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.130
Wow, Jun!

135
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.090
You went all out!

136
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.250
Wow!

137
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.550
But it was so crowded that I couldn

138
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.070
't see it very well.

139
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.070
I heard you went on the bullet train.

140
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.470
Have you ever been on it, Kank

141
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.570
ichi?

142
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.130
I've only been on the Toh

143
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.410
oku line.

144
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.710
Would you like some tea?

145
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.410
Thank you!

146
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.770
Everyone, please enjoy your meal.

147
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.030
Wow, another cake!

148
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.410
I'm always sorry, Ma'am.

149
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.630
It's okay.

150
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.250
Please get along with Jun from now on.

151
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.630
Yes!

152
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.010
Well, take your time.

153
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.980
Even when I go to the gym, I

154
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.080
don't get bored when I look at

155
00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.620
Kan-chan and the others.

156
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.340
You're the only one who's energetic,

157
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.220
Kankichi!

158
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.600
Jun!

159
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.560
Next time, I'll show you a bomb!

160
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.940
Instead, show me again during the test.

161
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.740
My eyesight is 2.

162
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.960
5, so I'm good at counting!

163
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.660
Anyway, that's an amazing book!

164
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.180
Did everyone read this book?

165
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.520
Pretty much.

166
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.400
I'll lend it to you anytime.

167
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.440
We don't like hot books like this.

168
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.060
Right, Kankichi?

169
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.680
It's enough for a textbook.

170
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.920
That's right.

171
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.340
I think this is interesting.

172
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.760
It's a Japanese...

173
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.180
It's called a Japanese Kado-

174
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.380
kyo.

175
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.960
I like this kind of thing.

176
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.700
Oh!

177
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.140
It's Kachidoki Bridge!

178
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.540
You're right!

179
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.280
Yeah, it's Kachidoki Bridge!

180
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.240
Do you know it?

181
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.040
Yeah, I know a little about bridges.

182
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.820
Shirahige, Kototoi, Azuma,

183
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.960
Komagata, Umaya, Kuramae,

184
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.560
Ryogoku, Kiyosu, E

185
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.880
itai, Tsukuda, Kachid

186
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.460
oki...

187
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.280
That's all!

188
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.200
It's a bridge over Sumida River.

189
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:12.980
Wow!

190
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.280
You made me remember it when I was

191
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:15.380
in elementary school.

192
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.820
My favorite thing is Kachidoki

193
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:18.960
Bridge.

194
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.900
It moves like this.

195
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.400
I want to see it.

196
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:25.720
What?

197
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.340
You've never seen it?

198
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.480
I want to see it, but it's

199
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.200
too far away.

200
00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:32.460
It's close.

201
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.360
It's just over Ginza.

202
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.380
All the cars stop, and the bridge opens

203
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.220
slowly.

204
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.620
When you look at it from the bridge,

205
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.960
the road approaches like a wall.

206
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.180
It's really powerful.

207
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240
It's amazing.

208
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.500
I want to see it with my own

209
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:48.600
eyes.

210
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.900
Let's go to Kachidoki

211
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.100
Bridge.

212
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.720
It's about 20 minutes by bicycle.

213
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.300
Yeah.

214
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.880
All right!

215
00:08:59.240 --> 00:08:59.480
Let's go!

216
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.710
There he is.

217
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.330
He's on the side of justice.

218
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.690
We'll be there soon.

219
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.140
Look, over there.

220
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.520
That bridge opens.

221
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.500
It's perfect from here.

222
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:45.820
It's perfect from here.

223
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.780
I always buy bread and watch it while

224
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:49.880
eating it.

225
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.520
Oh, the ship is coming.

226
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.020
All right.

227
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:53.700
It's opening.

228
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.580
It won't open.

229
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:05.880
It's strange.

230
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.660
It should always open at noon.

231
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.760
What's wrong?

232
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:17.370
What?

233
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.390
It won't open anymore?

234
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.770
It opened last night.

235
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.530
The bridge won't open anymore.

236
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.270
It's the age of land transport.

237
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.530
It's easier to carry things on water.

238
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.590
I didn't know that.

239
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.770
What?

240
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.890
The bridge won't open anymore?

241
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.030
Once the government decides, it won't open

242
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.270
again.

243
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.430
We're the ones who are always made

244
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.570
to cry by the flow of time.

245
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.250
They're always weak like us.

246
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.800
I'm disappointed that you came to see

247
00:10:59.800 --> 00:10:59.900
me.

248
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.080
I was looking forward to seeing you, Jun.

249
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.380
Don't let your guard down, Jun.

250
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.930
Kondo.

251
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:15.770
Yes!

252
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.470
Shibayama.

253
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.270
Yes!

254
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.390
Shiratori...

255
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.230
has a bloodstain.

256
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.410
Doctor!

257
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.330
What's wrong with Jun?

258
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.810
He's sleeping with a fever.

259
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.990
He was in shock when the bridge opened.

260
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.010
Let's go to his house.

261
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.470
What?

262
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.250
The weather?

263
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.390
I'm moving to Hokkaido.

264
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.950
I got to get along with everyone.

265
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.490
Even if we're far away, we're

266
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:48.930
friends.

267
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.030
Right?

268
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.830
Yeah.

269
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:51.970
That's right.

270
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.410
But...

271
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.910
the only regret I have...

272
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.690
is that I didn't get to see

273
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:57.870
the bridge open.

274
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.130
I wanted to see it with everyone.

275
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.010
Jun!

276
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.250
When are you going to Hokkaido?

277
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:06.730
The day after tomorrow.

278
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.370
That soon?

279
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.540
I see.

280
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.760
You're moving, Jun.

281
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.700
That's too bad.

282
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.620
I don't think I'll ever be

283
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.000
able to eat such a delicious cake again.

284
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.500
I'm going back to zero on my

285
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:24.600
blood sugar test!

286
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.840
Jun, you were really disappointed about the bridge

287
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:37.940
opening.

288
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.920
I wanted to show him the bridge opening.

289
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.620
That's right!

290
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.060
Let's show him the bridge opening!

291
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.100
What?

292
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.680
I said it's impossible.

293
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.000
We're going to open it.

294
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.100
That's right.

295
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.740
We're going to open the bridge and

296
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:54.960
show it to Jun.

297
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.680
What?

298
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.510
Kan-chan.

299
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.150
What are you doing here?

300
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.810
Come with me.

301
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.150
I'm going to show you the bridge

302
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.510
opening.

303
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.070
The bridge opening?

304
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.090
That's right!

305
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:30.810
Hurry up!

306
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.210
Wait, I'll go change.

307
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:38.910
This way!

308
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.410
Shh.

309
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.030
John, I'll be right back.

310
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.830
This is the best view.

311
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.490
Wait here, Jun.

312
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.590
Are we really going to open it?

313
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.530
Don't worry.

314
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.590
Leave it to us.

315
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.070
Let's go.

316
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.750
There are four towers on Kachid

317
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.850
oki Bridge.

318
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.490
The only one with stairs is that tower.

319
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.510
I'm sure that's the driver's

320
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:28.690
room.

321
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.590
I'll open the bridge, so you two

322
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.050
stop the car.

323
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:33.930
Got it.

324
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.820
Just as I thought, it's here.

325
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.240
The door is locked.

326
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.820
But it's no use.

327
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.120
I'm good at opening doors.

328
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.380
Stop!

329
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.840
I can't open this door either!

330
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.840
It's open.

331
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560
It's light.

332
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.720
There are a lot of switches.

333
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.880
I guess I have to turn it on.

334
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.720
How do I turn it on?

335
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.240
Stop!

336
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.780
Stop!

337
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:29.880
Please!

338
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.320
Stop!

339
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.580
I can't open it!

340
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.520
Stop!

341
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.120
We did it!

342
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:39.760
It stopped!

343
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.480
What are you guys doing?

344
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.000
Why did you stop the car?

345
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:59.460
Taxi!

346
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.700
The police found us!

347
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.110
Close the door!

348
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.750
Open the door!

349
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.730
What are you doing?

350
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:23.930
We can't.

351
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.170
The car won't stop.

352
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.770
The police will find us.

353
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.650
The plan was too reckless.

354
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.470
Let's stop.

355
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.930
Idiot!

356
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.690
Jun is waiting for us!

357
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.290
Will it really open?

358
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.370
But how do we open the first floor?

359
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.990
Let's give up.

360
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.410
Open the door!

361
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.710
Get out of there!

362
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.090
What are you going to do, Kank

363
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:48.230
ichi?

364
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.970
I'll open the bridge!

365
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:51.490
I'll open the bridge!

366
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.850
This is our only chance!

367
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.090
I'm so excited!

368
00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:58.670
Turn it on!

369
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.950
Don't touch it!

370
00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:09.200
It's on!

371
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.440
Put all the switches in!

372
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.819
Stop the car!

373
00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:16.819
Stop!

374
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:17.500
Please!

375
00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:18.060
Open it!

376
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.839
There's a signal on the bridge.

377
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.920
Idiot!

378
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.680
That bridge was supposed to be closed.

379
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.000
Move!

380
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.240
We're going up the bridge!

381
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.420
Please move!

382
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.420
I'll open the bridge!

383
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:42.880
Stop!

384
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.820
This is our only chance!

385
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.620
I'll open the bridge!

386
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:50.900
Open it!

387
00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:13.890
The bridge

388
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:14.570
...

389
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:37.130
Open the

390
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.390
door!

391
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.230
Open it more!

392
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.620
The bridge...

393
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.340
I knew it was real.

394
00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.920
The window...

395
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.440
The bridge is back!

396
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:32.950
We did

397
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.050
it!

398
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.030
It's fully open!

399
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.330
We did it!

400
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.950
The bridge is open!

401
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.510
It's like we're celebrating!

402
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.270
The bridge is open again?

403
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.450
That's how you open a bridge.

404
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.470
It's a sin, but look at that

405
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.790
face!

406
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.050
It's amazing.

407
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.610
It's more than I imagined.

408
00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:02.710
Did you see that?

409
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.900
Get ready.

410
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.140
I'm going to arrest you all.

411
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.300
We can't escape.

412
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:21.980
What do we do?

413
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.740
Come on!

414
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.520
What are you doing?

415
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.400
Hey!

416
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.600
Don't leave the bridge open!

417
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.120
I can't believe them!

418
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.320
Chief!

419
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.560
Help me!

420
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.800
Help me!

421
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.300
Then they swam all the way to

422
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.420
Hamari, ran away, and came back.

423
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.380
They were watching the whole thing.

424
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.120
It's been a long time.

425
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.180
I'm sure they were happy.

426
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.160
Of course.

427
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.460
I can't forget how happy they were.

428
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.520
But what if they threw the car away

429
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.820
and climbed the bridge?

430
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.240
Maybe...

431
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.780
That's impossible.

432
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.140
He was weak, but his heart was strong.

433
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.280
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.980
The guy in the car...

435
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.220
Jun!

436
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.960
Kan-chan?

437
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.000
Why are you here?

438
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.120
You look like a cop.

439
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.060
Kan-chan, you're a policeman?

440
00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.760
Don't laugh!

441
00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:58.560
You're a criminal!

442
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.720
No, I just thought the repairman would

443
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.260
take me.

444
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.140
Oh, right.

445
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.340
Here.

446
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.300
A college professor?

447
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.820
You must be famous, Jun!

448
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.020
It's all thanks to Kan-chan.

449
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.200
I can't forget how moved she was

450
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.220
when she risked her life to lift

451
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:18.320
the bridge.

452
00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.020
Now she's designing the bridge.

453
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.160
Then, what about the guy who climbed the

454
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:24.660
bridge?

455
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.900
There was something I wanted to find out.

456
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.220
The bridge is great!

457
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.020
Chief!

458
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.280
That's my friend, Professor Kogaku.

459
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.060
I heard everything, Ryotsu.

460
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.100
What?

461
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.600
You heard?

462
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.740
You're acting strange, Chief.

463
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.640
Yeah.

464
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.280
You said there was a cop who was

465
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.040
hanging with you when you climbed the bridge.

466
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.780
That's right!

467
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.560
Now that I think of it, I tried

468
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.640
my best to get him to move his

469
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.260
legs, but in the end, he fell into

470
00:22:59.260 --> 00:22:59.660
the river.

471
00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.840
Do you remember that cop's face?

472
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.580
Of course!

473
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.180
He had such serious eyes, thick eyebrows, a

474
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.340
long nose, and his mouth was like a

475
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:15.520
gill.

476
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.440
I almost forgot!

477
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.320
Ryo-chan.

478
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.040
Huh?

479
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.460
The chief's face.

480
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.680
What about the chief's face?

481
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.140
A long, gill-like nose, thin

482
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.080
eyes, and thick eyebrows.

483
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.080
What else?

484
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.730
I'm that cop!

485
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.380
I finally found the culprit behind that riot.

486
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.020
Please calm down, Chief!

487
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.300
Hey, wait, Ryotsu!

488
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.760
It's already too late!

489
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.720
All right!

490
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.660
Osmo's target is here!

491
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.520
The four of us will sit in the

492
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.360
front, and then we'll invite Reiko,

493
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.140
and take Nakagawa with us.

494
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.240
Who should we invite next?

495
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.340
Hey, Chief!

496
00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.280
I'm just kidding!

497
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.140
I said I'd invite you, Chief!

498
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.000
Next time, on Tokoton Osmo!

499
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:20.820
See you then!

500
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.000
Subbed

501
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:25.720
by

502
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.140
Dreadopp and Zedopp.
