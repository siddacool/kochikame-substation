00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.440

Everybody, come on!

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.980
Even if it's a little bit dark

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.360
I don't want to see it I

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.520

's 40,000 yen.

21
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.110
I can't buy it even if I

22
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.210
go up the hill.

23
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.770
I can't buy it.

24
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.530
I'm a gold-blooded man

25
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.630
with a yellow forehead.

26
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.550
Oh, no!

27
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.370
Oh, wait!

28
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.330
Wait!

29
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.710
Security alert!

30
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.170
You're making a mess here again.

31
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.970
Junpei, are you studying?

32
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.250
You have a test tomorrow, right?

33
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.150
Yeah, but...

34
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.430
Even if I do it now, I won

35
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.170
't get smarter all of a sudden.

36
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.970
That's true.

37
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.310
Ryo-san!

38
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.650
Riku!

39
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.030
You're a grown-up now, but

40
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.370
you're with a kid.

41
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.090
What's so good about that?

42
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.730
It's a full-action robot with

43
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.810
a 4-channel radio.

44
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.250
It's a masterpiece.

45
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.750
Those who understand will understand.

46
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.930
Those who don't understand won't understand.

47
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.850
I guess that's how it is.

48
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.990
If Junpei gets at least 80 points

49
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.050
on the test, I'll buy you as

50
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.150
much as you want.

51
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.010
Really?

52
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.690
You'll buy me as much as I

53
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.790
want?

54
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.310
Just an example.

55
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.210
There's no way you'll get 80

56
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.830
points.

57
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.630
Yeah.

58
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.350
Ryo-san...

59
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.970
You'll get it!

60
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.950
Look at this year's Nagashima

61
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.230
Giants.

62
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.850
They turned the 11.

63
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.890
5 point difference in the first half and

64
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.290
won a miraculous league championship.

65
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.770
If you're motivated, you can do anything.

66
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.310
If Junpei gets 80 points, I'm

67
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.070
sure he'll buy you that rad

68
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.170
io.

69
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.730
Well, yeah, I guess so.

70
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.150
All right, it's decided!

71
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.630
Let's go, Junpei!

72
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.230
Hey, Kappi!

73
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.010
Yeah!

74
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.010
Wait, Ryo-san!

75
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.890
Ryo-san, wait up!

76
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.810
Hey, what are you going to do, R

77
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.330
yo-san?

78
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.230
What are you going to do?

79
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.570
Leave it to me.

80
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.750
In return, if you get the radio, I

81
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.490
'll buy you one for free.

82
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.710
Yeah!

83
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.990
I'll do it!

84
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.550
I'll definitely do it!

85
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.840
A tutor?

86
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.500
What about the tutor?

87
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.600
What's wrong with the tutor?

88
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.500
Why is Senpai here again?

89
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.820
Can you do it?

90
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.500
Ryo-chan is a tutor.

91
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.080
What?

92
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.060
Don't make fun of me!

93
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.399
What am I going to do if I

94
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.499
don't even know how to study?

95
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.079
Let's get started!

96
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.019
Get started?

97
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.880
The test is tomorrow, right?

98
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.920
That's why!

99
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.700
I'm going to study 24 hours a

100
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.160
day from now on!

101
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.020
What?

102
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.860
That's too much!

103
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.140
It's not too much!

104
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.520
When I was in high school, I didn

105
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.220
't sleep for three days to study, and

106
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.860
I passed the test!

107
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.440
What?

108
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.340
You didn't sleep at all?

109
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.380
Why are you saying that again?

110
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.360
If I slept, I'd forget everything I

111
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.460
learned.

112
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.460
That's terrible.

113
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.360
But normally, people's concentration doesn't last

114
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.620
that long, right?

115
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.540
Yes.

116
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.000
Even at work, they say it's more

117
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.580
efficient to take a break.

118
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.660
That's a stupid story.

119
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.720
In my case, my concentration is different.

120
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.660
Common sense doesn't work.

121
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.720
I think it's more correct to say

122
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.820
that common sense doesn't work.

123
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.300
Listen carefully.

124
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.600
Normally, your pace will gradually increase, and then

125
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.020
you'll fall.

126
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.860
But in my case, I start at the

127
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.900
peak, and then I rush into the test

128
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.800
day.

129
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.020
Your concentration lasts a long time.

130
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.780
I can't believe it.

131
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.100
Why not?

132
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.840
Even if you think you're focused, you

133
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.620
're actually pretty distracted.

134
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.680
In my case, my entire nervous system is

135
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.180
focused on the test, I'm 100%

136
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.280
serious.

137
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.720
But if I don't pay any attention,

138
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.200
I fall to zero.

139
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.940
I see.

140
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.420
It's like a man-made airplane.

141
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.780
That's like you, Ryo-chan.

142
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.760
And so, I'm going to start my

143
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.260
training...

144
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.120
Where did they go?

145
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.200
Where did they go?

146
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.900
I knew it!

147
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.100
I hid my plastic model!

148
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.300
Hey, wait a minute!

149
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.200
Ryo-chan, do you really think

150
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.800
you're studying?

151
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.440
I know your concentration, but your academic ability

152
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.360
is a different matter.

153
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.740
What's going on?

154
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.320
How do you become a tutor at home?

155
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.220
I don't know.

156
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.560
How long are you going to play?

157
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.900
Huh?

158
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.160
Are you really going to study?

159
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.480
Are you?

160
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.820
Of course!

161
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.400
If it's for the radio show, I

162
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.020
'm going to do it no matter what!

163
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.220
Come on, give me the test paper.

164
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.580
What's the test range?

165
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.240
All right, let's start with the language

166
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.700
test.

167
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.380
Let's see, what's this?

168
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.300
Answer the meaning of the following phrase.

169
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.540
50, 100...

170
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.720
It's pretty easy!

171
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.600
No, no, it's obvious.

172
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.120
It's 50, 100.

173
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.880
This is the starting line.

174
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.760
All right, Junpei.

175
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.680
Try walking 100 steps from here.

176
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.700
Okay.

177
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.700
One, two, three, four...

178
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.580
Oh, really?

179
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.600
...

180
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.980
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

181
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.220
Oh, Ryo-chan.

182
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.820
It's dangerous to play on the road.

183
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.360
Grandma, this is studying.

184
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.300
Studying?

185
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.840
Oh, my God.

186
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.880
100 steps.

187
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.200
100 steps.

188
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.880
All right, Ryo-chan.

189
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.320
All right.

190
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.760
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

191
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.340
Ryo-chan, what are you going

192
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.680
to do?

193
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.140
I do not know.

194
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.380
26, 47, 48, 49, 50.

195
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.520
It's the same.

196
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.700
That's right.

197
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.760
In other words, 50 steps and 100 steps

198
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.000
mean that even if the child's feet

199
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.680
are 100 steps away, When you grow up,

200
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.320
you can go 50 steps.

201
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.600
Yeah, I got it.

202
00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.920
I see.

203
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.960
There was such an interpretation.

204
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.020
That's not possible.

205
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.940
Eye drops from the second floor?

206
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.920
Hey, Ryo-san.

207
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.060
What do you mean?

208
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.560
Then you should try it.

209
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.520
Let's go, Ryo-san.

210
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.200
All right, let's go.

211
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.920
Aim well.

212
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.120
I do not know.

213
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.500
Are you really going to put eye drops

214
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:23.600
from the second floor?

215
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.659
I did it.

216
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.679
How is it, Ryo-san?

217
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.260
Do you understand?

218
00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.200
I feel numb.

219
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.480
When you put eye drops from the second

220
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.280
floor, the acceleration changes and

221
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.620
it feels very good.

222
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.420
Hey, Ryo-san.

223
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:50.860
Yes.

224
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.440
That explanation is completely different.

225
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.220
What?

226
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.640
Eye drops from the second floor are poisonous

227
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.920
and useless.

228
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.080
It is said that it has no effect.

229
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.640
50 steps and 100 steps is a phrase

230
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.540
from China.

231
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.040
50 people who ran 50 steps on the

232
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.680
battlefield can not help but laugh at 100

233
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.900
people who ran 100 steps.

234
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.700
It means that there is not much difference

235
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.060
between the two.

236
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.240
I do not know.

237
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.220
Yes, hello.

238
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.860
Shut up, Reiko.

239
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.340
I can not read it.

240
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.500
What is it?

241
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.300
Well...

242
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.880
I received a call from a neighbor.

243
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.460
He told me to take away the vehicle

244
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:27.560
that was illegally parked.

245
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.800
Reiko, would you like to go with

246
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:29.900
me?

247
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.440
Yes.

248
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.200
All right, Ryo-chan.

249
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.060
I'll be back soon, so do not

250
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.620
tell me anything strange.

251
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.700
All right, all right.

252
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.960
Hurry up and go to work.

253
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.580
You can take your time.

254
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:41.820
What?

255
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.000
Well, the noisy one is gone.

256
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.760
Do not hesitate to ask if you do

257
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.060
not understand.

258
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.780
Yes, Ryo-san.

259
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.420
What?

260
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.160
What is a crane turtle?

261
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.580
What?

262
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.560
A crane turtle?

263
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.660
This.

264
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.780
Well, what is it?

265
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.040
There are a crane and a turtle.

266
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.460
If you count the number of heads, there

267
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.300
are a total of 20.

268
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.900
If you count the number of legs, there

269
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.460
are 62.

270
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.480
How many cranes are there?

271
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.740
How many turtles are there?

272
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.900
Well, the crane has two legs and the

273
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.480
turtle has four.

274
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.940
Well...

275
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.420
It's a crane turtle!

276
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:22.840
Help me!

277
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.640
No, help me!

278
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.480
Hey, Ryo-san.

279
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.480
Did you catch the crane?

280
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.200
Shut up!

281
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.960
Hey, how about the turtle?

282
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.960
I got it!

283
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.780
All right, it's about time.

284
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.460
Well, do not be angry.

285
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.660
It's in place of the crane.

286
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.360
Look, there's a turtle.

287
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.800
All right, this is finally a crane tu

288
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:53.900
rtle.

289
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.120
What?

290
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.480
Hey, hey.

291
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.060
If you look at the legs, you will

292
00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.480
not understand.

293
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.540
Hey, stop it.

294
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.740
Oh, no!

295
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.640
I do not want a crane turtle.

296
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.040
I want a crane turtle.

297
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.520
A crane turtle is the first thing I

298
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:07.800
want to study.

299
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:13.910
This is a crane turtle.

300
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:15.390
That's right.

301
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.410
The principle of the PET bottle rocket is

302
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:17.990
to use the law of reciprocating

303
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.510
and anti-replicating.

304
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.630
The law of reciprocating and anti

305
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.110
-replicating is the theory that

306
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.990
the side that puts the force also receives

307
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.590
the force only in this amount.

308
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.250
If you send a large amount of air

309
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.990
into a water-filled bottle and shoot

310
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.950
it at once...

311
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.910
The compressed air will blow out the water,

312
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.630
and the bottle with the same amount of

313
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.170
force will fly away.

314
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.010
This is the same principle as a real

315
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:45.770
space rocket.

316
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.390
Hey, Ryo-san, can't you

317
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.110
make a bigger one?

318
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.670
A bigger one?

319
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.270
All right, here's the application problem.

320
00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.870
All right, it's done.

321
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.770
A drum can rocket, Ryo-ts

322
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:01.890
ugo!

323
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.610
Let's try to launch it!

324
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.190
All right, here we go!

325
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.670
Ryo-san, we'll be counting

326
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.770
on you!

327
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.890
You coward!

328
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.850
Ouch!

329
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.290
Ryo-san, are you all right?

330
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.490
Are you all right?

331
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.170
All right, let's try the social science

332
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:37.630
next.

333
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.650
There's a door on the right side

334
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.750
of the road.

335
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.650
I didn't know there were so many

336
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.210
signs on the map.

337
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.230
So the launch pad is a penalty mark.

338
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.430
You're acting up.

339
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.470
Maru's the one who should be

340
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.690
doing it.

341
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.670
Maru's the one who should be

342
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.810
doing it.

343
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.710
Oh, a ninja mark!

344
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.310
Oh, this is a manji shur

345
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.890
iken mark.

346
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.030
There were other ones, like shuji

347
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.390
shuriken, roppou shur

348
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.910
iken, and happou shuriken.

349
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.270
You're so knowledgeable, Ryo-san.

350
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.190
Of course I am.

351
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.270
By the way, you can make shu

352
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.350
ji shuriken with origami.

353
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.550
Really?

354
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.710
All right, it's done.

355
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.030
It's so cool!

356
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.230
I used to make this a lot and

357
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.610
play ninja.

358
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.430
Teach me!

359
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.690
All right, let's fold the origami

360
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.730
first.

361
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.390
And then...

362
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.440
Keiichi Nakagawa has returned.

363
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.820
Reiko Akimoto has returned.

364
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.500
Thank you for your hard work.

365
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.800
How's the tutor doing?

366
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.500
It seems like she's doing it quietly.

367
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.820
How's it going, Ryo-chan?

368
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.920
Darn it!

369
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.080
How dare you!

370
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.320
I'm Ryo Kuma.

371
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:12.940
I won't let you hit me with

372
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.020
that weird shuriken!

373
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.800
What did you say?

374
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.240
I'm Ryo Kuma!

375
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.200
Just as I thought.

376
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.560
You're overreacting.

377
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.160
You're just like a kid.

378
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.180
Hey, you're distracting me!

379
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.180
Hey, Ryo-chan!

380
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.140
Ryo-chan!

381
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.400
Oh, you're back.

382
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.400
Well, this is...

383
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.620
No!

384
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.340
I-It's dirty.

385
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.580
I knew you'd do that.

386
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.460
H-History is simple.

387
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.880
If you make a circle, you'll get

388
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.820
two points for sure.

389
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.200
Yeah.

390
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400
Um...

391
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.640
What year was the Taika Reb

392
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:10.740
irth?

393
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.400
What?

394
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.540
The Taika Rebirth?

395
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:14.380
No!

396
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.520
It's the Taika Rebirth!

397
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.140
Huh?

398
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.800
It was in 645.

399
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.060
Huh?

400
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.300
The way to remember it is...

401
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.700
Mujiko no Yozukuri, Ta

402
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.460
ika no Kaishin.

403
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:25.940
What?

404
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.040
I see.

405
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.440
Now that you mention it, there was also

406
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.500
Hito Nami ni Ogoreyo.

407
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.260
That's the way to remember Heih

408
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:31.640
oukon.

409
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.060
Suihei Ribe, Boku no

410
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.280
Fune.

411
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.760
That's Gensokigo.

412
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.400
Huh?

413
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.700
There's also Nakuyo Ugu

414
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.360
isu, Heian Kyo, Hiyoku

415
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.400
ni Moeru Kolombusu.

416
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.660
That's it!

417
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.840
Hiyoku ni Moeru Kol

418
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.700
ombusu, Suikin Chikam

419
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.260
oku, Dotten Kaimei, K

420
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.940
yojin Taihou, Tamagoyaki,

421
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.440
Oh Kaneda Hirouka, Oh Kan

422
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.220
eda Hirouka...

423
00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.560
What was it?

424
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.920
What the heck is that?

425
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.060
What are you going to teach the kids?

426
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.220
That's what I learned when I was

427
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:05.320
a kid.

428
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:05.460
What is it?

429
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.520
If you have a problem, tell me.

430
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.780
Hey, hey.

431
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.920
You're not the only one who's

432
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.280
excited.

433
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.580
Tell me.

434
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.420
Tell me.

435
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.600
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

436
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.940
You remember that 645 is Taika

437
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.200
no Katsushin, right?

438
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.600
Yeah.

439
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.980
Next is Ono no Imoko, but

440
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.520
...

441
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.820
Oh, I know that one.

442
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.800
Ono no Imoko is famous for

443
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.580
eating sweet potatoes and booing.

444
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.820
It's a nostalgic name.

445
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.980
Did you become a swordsman after eating

446
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.080
sweet potatoes?

447
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.600
Huh?

448
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.480
A swordsman?

449
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.220
Wasn't Ono no Imoko just

450
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.260
someone who ate sweet potatoes and boo

451
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:38.360
ed?

452
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.380
So why does it have a historical name?

453
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.540
Because it's the first time in Japan

454
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.580
that someone ate sweet potatoes and boo

455
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:45.740
ed.

456
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.300
Oh, I don't want to hear it.

457
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.220
There's no point in saying it.

458
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.450
There was a swordsman, not a swords

459
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:56.670
man, right?

460
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.010
There is.

461
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.390
About 20 years after the swordsman.

462
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.090
There should have been a swordsman war.

463
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.849
Yes.

464
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.310
It's a ship I used to go

465
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:04.950
to China.

466
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:06.530
Yeah.

467
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:07.150
Huh?

468
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.790
Wasn't that ship shaped like this?

469
00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.730
It's a ship with a lot of

470
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.450
people on board, right?

471
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.790
Amazing!

472
00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.230
I think it was probably shaped like that.

473
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.490
You remember it well, Kyo-chan.

474
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.670
Oh, I'm starting to remember it.

475
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.950
I remember playing a prank on the teacher

476
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.569
when I saw U-Boat sell

477
00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:23.190
ing dorae in Gento City.

478
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.770
Wow, that's so cool.

479
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.970
But you remember the details of the ship

480
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:32.310
well.

481
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.470
I imitated the ship and drew it

482
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.810
over and over again.

483
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.470
I can also draw Kanrinmaru.

484
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:38.850
Kanrinmaru was made in the

485
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.070
Netherlands.

486
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.610
It's a small wooden warship about

487
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:42.710
50 meters long.

488
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.750
Wow!

489
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.090
I think it was used as a training

490
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:46.430
ship for the Bakufu Navy.

491
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.410
It had five cannons on each side.

492
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.610
You know a lot.

493
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.650
Someone went to America on this, right?

494
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.030
Um, who was it?

495
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.130
It wasn't Katsushin, it

496
00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:57.610
was...

497
00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.530
Katsukai, right?

498
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:59.830
Yes, that person.

499
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.590
He doesn't know much about history, but

500
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.650
he remembers the illustrations in the textbook.

501
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.230
I'll give you a mission.

502
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.610
How about a helicopter?

503
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:07.470
A helicopter?

504
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.550
Um, I think it looked like this.

505
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.150
Wow!

506
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.070
Amazing!

507
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:14.910
Yes, I think it looks like it.

508
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.710
Why did you draw it right away?

509
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.890
It was in the textbook.

510
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.070
I was always doing pranks like this

511
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.170
during class.

512
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.190
There was also Sugita Genpaku.

513
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.350
He had a face like this when he

514
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.230
drew in the Ukyoen style.

515
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.010
Wow!

516
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.830
How is it?

517
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.070
Isn't it good?

518
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.450
The head of this hand was the most

519
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.030
fun to draw, so I was happy at

520
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.130
the time.

521
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.950
Wow!

522
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.890
Hey, Ryo.

523
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.310
Can you draw Minamoto no Yorit

524
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.470
omo?

525
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:41.790
How about Hideyoshi?

526
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.510
Yes, of course.

527
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:46.970
Yay!

528
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:48.890
I can draw him.

529
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.230
I can draw Ieyasu, Nob

530
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.990
unaga, and even Frank Zabier.

531
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.690
Wow!

532
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.450
Senpai.

533
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.530
Do you know who Sugita Genp

534
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.330
aku is?

535
00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.270
Of course I do.

536
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.930
He's definitely a Rakuoka.

537
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.030
He's the one who drew the famous

538
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.010
Kaitai Shinshou.

539
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.570
No, no.

540
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.690
I thought he was a Rakuoka

541
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.030
when I saw him from the second floor.

542
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.630
Was he the one who drew the Y

543
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.510
ajikita Zouchuki?

544
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.990
That's Juppensha Ikku,

545
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.230
right?

546
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:19.510
I've learned a lot.

547
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:21.750
I don't know.

548
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.810
I don't care what happens to the

549
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.910
test.

550
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.510
Hey!

551
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:27.770
You can't draw that!

552
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.150
Okay!

553
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.730
You're pretty good at drawing.

554
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.770
I'm going to teach you something boring,

555
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:38.450
Ryo.

556
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.330
You were impressed, weren't you?

557
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.130
That's all for today's lesson.

558
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.330
Bye-bye!

559
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.570
Hey, what are you going to do with

560
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:46.670
the radio?

561
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:47.770
It can't be helped.

562
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.790
You're so mean.

563
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.730
Ryo, bring it back.

564
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:53.730
What?

565
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.210
Me?

566
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.250
I'm teaching you not to do things

567
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:56.410
like this.

568
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.470
It's part of the lesson.

569
00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:58.890
What?

570
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.850
Where did they go?

571
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:08.870
Those guys!

572
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.550
It can't be!

573
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.050
What's going on?

574
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.150
Ryo, are you all right?

575
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:18.950
Shut up!

576
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.270
Hey, I found them!

577
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.850
Ryo!

578
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:25.130
Ryo!

579
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.370
You guys!

580
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:27.950
That's enough!

581
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.650
You're getting on my nerves!

582
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.350
I'm sorry.

583
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.950
Ryo, look!

584
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.190
You can't do that!

585
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.350
Look!

586
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.710
It looks just like your drawing!

587
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.570
What's that?

588
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:42.670
Ryo!

589
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.030
Hey!

590
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.930
That's Tatsuya Mamushiro!

591
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.390
I knew it!

592
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.410
He's disguised himself!

593
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.250
Stop right there!

594
00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.310
You're not getting away!

595
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.190
Damn it!

596
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.170
Ryo!

597
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.670
Ryo!

598
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.270
Ryo!

599
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.390
Tatsuya Mamushiro!

600
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:17.230
You're under arrest!

601
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.890
How did you know?

602
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.190
You really are a piece of work.

603
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.170
I was just trying to show them what

604
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:33.670
I'm made of.

605
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.110
You're doing great.

606
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.690
Now that I've passed the test, I

607
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.210
have nothing more to say.

608
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.170
Of course you have!

609
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.290
Who do you think taught you?

610
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:47.890
Ryo!

611
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.600
Look!

612
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.360
You got an 80!

613
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.800
No, I got a 50.

614
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.900
What?

615
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.640
You didn't even get a 30.

616
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.960
Why?

617
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.500
I helped arrest the criminal, so the police

618
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.500
bought me.

619
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.220
That's great.

620
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.400
Yeah!

621
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.420
Studying is not everything in this world.

622
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.800
My practical way of studying is what I

623
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.520
call true study.

624
00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:19.780
Yeah!

625
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.600
For example, my boss came here to study,

626
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.540
so he became so stubborn.

627
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.720
Even when he saw the variety show on

628
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.160
TV, he wouldn't laugh.

629
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.020
He'd get angry.

630
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.300
Hey, senpai.

631
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.180
I don't know!

632
00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.620
I mean, it's true.

633
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.500
A stubborn person like that can't keep

634
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:36.600
up with his subordinates.

635
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.500
He's just a tourist.

636
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:39.740
Ryo!

637
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.680
Boss!

638
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.860
You did a great job yesterday.

639
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.660
You helped the citizens and arrested the criminal.

640
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.500
I'm so proud of you.

641
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:50.840
Sir.

642
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.760
By the way, the graffiti of your practical

643
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.200
way of studying.

644
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.180
Boss, you're so funny.

645
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.640
They did it on their own.

646
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.420
Stop talking nonsense and erase it!

647
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.000
Yeah!

648
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.000
Why am I the only one who gets

649
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.900
along with him?

650
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.280
Hey, Ryo.

651
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.200
I heard you had a good time.

652
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:17.860
Yeah!

653
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.540
What?

654
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.060
Hey, you guys help too!

655
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.180
Ryo!

656
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:30.000
Come here!

657
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.940
Damn it!

658
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.680
How stupid!

659
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.880
I can't do this!

660
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.580
It's fun to clean up.

661
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.760
Ryoichi.

662
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.620
Did you forget what I said earlier?

663
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.000
I'm going to deduct your salary from

664
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.100
my salary.

665
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.920
What?

666
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.340
That's not true!

667
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:51.960
Boss!

668
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.590
Bonus!

669
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:07.610
Bonus!

670
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.470
I'm so happy!

671
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:09.970
What?

672
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.270
You want me to pay you back?

673
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.390
No way!

674
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:13.530
This is the money I earned by sweating!

675
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.430
I won't give it to anyone!

676
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.570
Next time, Bonus Battle!

677
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:20.570
See you then!

678
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.670
Next

679
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:40.700
time,

680
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:53.880
Bonus

681
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.160

682
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.020
See you then!

edopp.

685
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:32.560
Subbed by Dreadopp and Z

edopp.
