00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.070
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) I'm going to show you how to

2
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.170
do it.

3
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.790
First, you have to make a circle.

4
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.490
And make a circle.

5
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.850
The Rocky Tentacles How

6
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.450
was that?

7
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.410
Take a look at this!

8
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.170
That is the result of your medical examination

9
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.550
the other day.

10
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.610
What's the matter with that?

11
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.290
Your blood pressure is high.

12
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.290
You should be careful of your urination.

13
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.150
Where are you looking at?

14
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.850
Here.

15
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.430
Here.

16
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.890
You are only 35 years old.

17
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.850
You are 35 years old.

18
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.410
35 years old.

19
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.330
What?

20
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.070
You are young.

21
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.570
Do you have any secret?

22
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.070
Ha-ha-ha.

23
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.790
Actually, about three months ago, I joined an

24
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.030
athletic club and started building my physical strength.

25
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.610
Athletic club?

26
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.669
That's right.

27
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.830
I was invited by a friend and started

28
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.930
going there.

29
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.030
It's effective.

30
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.150
I won't lose to a young man.

31
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.450
No.

32
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.370
I won't lose to Ryotsu,

33
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.290
either.

34
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.010
By the way, you look good these days.

35
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.250
That's right.

36
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.830
My shoulders are better, too.

37
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.130
What do you think, Terai?

38
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.190
Why don't you join us?

39
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.110
Ha-ha-ha.

40
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.330
But, I don't have enough exercise.

41
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.650
I get tired easily.

42
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.090
Don't worry about that.

43
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.990
First, you should check your physical strength on

44
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.230
a computer and start with the menu that

45
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.330
suits you.

46
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.310
You are doing well.

47
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.850
Good morning, sir.

48
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.830
What do you mean, good morning?

49
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.590
As usual, you don't look well.

50
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.850
Do you think you can work properly?

51
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.890
Don't worry about that.

52
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.310
I have confidence in my physical strength.

53
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.610
I made a plastic model and stayed up

54
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.710
all night.

55
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.030
The night before that, I played two new

56
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.550
games.

57
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.130
The night before that, I had a drink

58
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.630
with my friends.

59
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.750
You idiot!

60
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.170
He seems to have more power in his

61
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.390
voice than usual.

62
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.050
Is this because of his athleticism?

63
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.110
Athleticism?

64
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.690
What do you mean, sir?

65
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.250
Don't call me that.

66
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.290
I haven't eaten anything yet.

67
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.130
You should train your head before you train

68
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.230
your body.

69
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.390
What?

70
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.970
It's not food, senpai.

71
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.990
Athletic club is a club where you

72
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.170
can train your body and play sports for

73
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.270
your health.

74
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.890
With the latest fitness machines and physical fitness

75
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.650
tests by computers, you can scientifically train your

76
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.790
body.

77
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.670
I know.

78
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.670
You make money, don't you?

79
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.430
How stupid.

80
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.510
You pay money to exercise.

81
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.850
You don't understand, do you, Ryo?

82
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.770
It's common sense to spend money for

83
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.750
beauty and health.

84
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.410
In Europe, people who can't quit smoking

85
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.970
and people who are obese are seen as

86
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.550
people who can't even manage their own

87
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.490
bodies, so they can't be elite business

88
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.670
men.

89
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.150
That's right.

90
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.750
Especially people who can't manage themselves at

91
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.850
all should definitely experience it once.

92
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.269
That's why you don't have to

93
00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:18.890
go there.

94
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:19.850
You have physical strength.

95
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.670
You idiot!

96
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.850
I'm telling you that you need a

97
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.610
scientifically calculated exercise.

98
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.950
I'm sorry, but if you let me

99
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.790
say it, it's like throwing money away.

100
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.990
What did you say?

101
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.090
All right.

102
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.830
Let's see who has more physical strength.

103
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.250
Let's have an athletic match.

104
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.350
A match?

105
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.410
Stop it.

106
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.390
You're so immature.

107
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.090
Are you scared now?

108
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.430
Say it as many times as you want.

109
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.450
What's so funny about using physical strength

110
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.750
for nothing?

111
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.250
You're so stupid.

112
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.250
You're always so talkative.

113
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.010
Well, there's no need to compete.

114
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.990
I can see the result.

115
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.810
I understand.

116
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.930
I'll accept that challenge.

117
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.210
Oh, you're motivated.

118
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.670
I don't care if you regret it.

119
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.790
After all, my physical strength is...

120
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.890
Here.

121
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.290
As proven, I have a body of 35.

122
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.570
However, let me decide the place.

123
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.210
At Kameyari Athletic Square,

124
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.510
from 2 o'clock tomorrow.

125
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.770
All right.

126
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.970
Be prepared, Ryotsu.

127
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.350
What's wrong with you all of a

128
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.030
sudden, Senpai?

129
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.530
Something's suspicious.

130
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.970
No, no.

131
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.550
It's nothing.

132
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.170
Hey, what's this?

133
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.270
Kameyari Athletic Square Open

134
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.690
Commemoration?

135
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.450
A 1 million yen event.

136
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.190
So, this is the event.

137
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.250
I thought it was strange.

138
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.770
I understand, Buu-chan.

139
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.430
What?

140
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.590
I just happened to have a prize money

141
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.690
for athletics.

142
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.460
You don't have to participate.

143
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.140
But, I want the 1 million yen.

144
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.780
I want to be a member of the

145
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.160
Genoron.

146
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.180
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

147
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.320
Oh, are you all here?

148
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.080
Yes.

149
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.940
We're here for the event.

150
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.840
I see.

151
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.500
You're a great person.

152
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.700
What's the matter?

153
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.480
What could it be?

154
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.280
Ah, that voice.

155
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.760
Kameyari's original master.

156
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.100
Oh, you guys are here, too?

157
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.380
It's awful to see Ryotsu

158
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.760
in a place like this.

159
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.480
It's true.

160
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.820
We're here, so we should go somewhere

161
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.920
else.

162
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.840
You say what you want to say.

163
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.880
Hey, Ryo-san.

164
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.840
You're here after all.

165
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.340
Ramen shop, model shop, liquor shop.

166
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.340
Ryo-san.

167
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.660
Hurry up and pay the bill.

168
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.640
Don't you have anything else to say?

169
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.180
We don't want to say it either.

170
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.400
If you don't like it, give it

171
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.800
back to us.

172
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.200
Wait.

173
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.120
When I get the prize, I'll give

174
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.100
it back to you.

175
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.160
Prize?

176
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.300
What are you talking about?

177
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.580
Oh, nothing.

178
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.000
Everyone, thank you for coming today.

179
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.320
We're going to have a survival race

180
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.420
to win 1 million yen.

181
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.720
What's that?

182
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.080
Ryo-san, what's going on?

183
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.440
What is it?

184
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.120
I didn't know at all.

185
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.480
You used me.

186
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.160
I can't believe you're

187
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.440
using a poor sport for money.

188
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.440
Well, well, boss.

189
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.720
It doesn't change the game.

190
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.920
Or do you want to admit defeat without

191
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.020
fighting?

192
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.660
No, I'm not going to lose to

193
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:41.760
you.

194
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.240
Then please enter.

195
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.580
Participants, please change into this inside.

196
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.780
What's this?

197
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.760
What is it?

198
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.080
Isn't it a cockroach?

199
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.740
Then please move here.

200
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.000
Why do I have to dress like this?

201
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.240
I don't want to.

202
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.940
Wow, it's a huge kitchen.

203
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.580
What is this?

204
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.520
Hey, are we going to be cockroaches?

205
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.559
Everyone, welcome to the 10th edition of

206
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.520
the Cockroach Athletics.

207
00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.400
In this 120-fold kitchen diorama,

208
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.320
you can see us go through many obstacles.

209
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.020
You could say it's a real cockro

210
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.000
ach experience.

211
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.300
How dare you make something like this?

212
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.860
If you're going to quit, do it

213
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.120
now.

214
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.400
What?

215
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.660
Who said I was going to quit?

216
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.580
It's a game.

217
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.340
The goal is the Anpan on the

218
00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.920
stalker in the refrigerator.

219
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.820
The person who reaches this Anpan first

220
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.460
in 30 minutes is the winner.

221
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.200
There are three courses on the floor.

222
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.900
You can choose which course you want to

223
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.000
take.

224
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.180
Please choose your favorite course.

225
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.500
It's best to go from the front.

226
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.720
No, there are too many gaps.

227
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.740
There must be a trick.

228
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.340
Let's go up and down.

229
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.160
Now, let's see what you've got.

230
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.420
Ready.

231
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.020
Start.

232
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.720
This is the best.

233
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.020
I'm going to do my best.

234
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.860
Don't underestimate me, Ryo.

235
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.300
Let's leave it to Ryo.

236
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.100
Yes.

237
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.020
It's hard to climb.

238
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.200
Break through the front.

239
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.620
One more time.

240
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.780
The cockroach-avoidance device

241
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.500
is on the floor.

242
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.000
It's real.

243
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.880
It's so real.

244
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.960
There's no electricity here.

245
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.690
It's dark and I can't see

246
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:36.830
well.

247
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.850
My tongue is sticky.

248
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.730
What is this?

249
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.310
Oh, no.

250
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.370
Is this...

251
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.150
It's a cockroach.

252
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.470
My tongue is sticky.

253
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.390
It's a cockroach-avoid

254
00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:58.590
ance device.

255
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.630
I'm going to win the prize.

256
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.630
Help me.

257
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.110
Ryo, help me.

258
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.290
Yes.

259
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.290
If you help me, I'll help you.

260
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.450
That's cruel.

261
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.230
I don't care.

262
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.390
Wait.

263
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.410
Help me.

264
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.170
No.

265
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.530
Catch me.

266
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.510
You're late.

267
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.970
Ryo, go ahead.

268
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.770
Damn it.

269
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.310
It seems to disappear every minute.

270
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.150
It seems to disappear every minute.

271
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.770
It disappears the next time it disappears.

272
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.230
One minute.

273
00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.310
I can't wait a minute.

274
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.810
I can't believe it.

275
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.710
It's not a human.

276
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.810
It's not a human.

277
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.510
Don't push yourself too hard.

278
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:29.490
Chief, there's a thief.

279
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.870
What?

280
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.970
Where?

281
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.450
Where?

282
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.230
I can't cross the castle with my

283
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.390
physical strength alone.

284
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.770
I have to use my brain.

285
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.810
You're tough.

286
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:49.770
I'll go ahead.

287
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.350
You're dirty.

288
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.450
There's a thief over there.

289
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.150
Chief, there's no fool who can be

290
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.970
caught by the same hand.

291
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.090
There's 10,000 yen over there.

292
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.130
10,000 yen?

293
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.190
What a simple guy.

294
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.250
What do you think, Ryo?

295
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.190
Do something with your proud head.

296
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.250
Damn it.

297
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.410
I'm not going to lose yet.

298
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.820
I wonder how far Ryo and the

299
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.640
others have gone.

300
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.040
I can't pull this.

301
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.280
What?

302
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.600
Ryo is inside the cockroach?

303
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.540
Yes.

304
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.280
It's impossible for Ryo to escape

305
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.600
from there.

306
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.300
If he's not there, there's no

307
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:48.680
need to panic.

308
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.520
I was a little too excited earlier.

309
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.520
What?

310
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.000
Why are there so many things stuck together?

311
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:16.900
That's amazing.

312
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.100
He made the impossible possible.

313
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.400
He's as strong as a cockroach.

314
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.380
What a great physical strength.

315
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.560
Chief, the forecast is at a high pace.

316
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.100
At this rate, a considerable number of people

317
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.800
will reach the goal within 30 minutes.

318
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.540
What?

319
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.620
I told you, didn't I?

320
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.020
What are you going to do with the

321
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:38.420
prize money?

322
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.340
We don't have the money right now.

323
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.960
I can't help it.

324
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:46.900
I can't believe I'm going to

325
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.240
use this.

326
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.540
I'm too late.

327
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:03.920
I'm in trouble.

328
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.280
I can't run away.

329
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.550
What's wrong with me?

330
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.890
Did you see the power of the robot

331
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.330
arm?

332
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.350
It's too early to be surprised.

333
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.110
The chopsticks are in the way.

334
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.710
I can't stand this.

335
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.910
But thanks to you, I got the chopsticks

336
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.350
and the spoon.

337
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.670
I can't stand it anymore.

338
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.810
Ryo?

339
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.170
What?

340
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:19.850
Were you with your friends?

341
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.290
Yes.

342
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.610
They attacked me and I ran away.

343
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.610
But I couldn't get out.

344
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:28.950
Damn it.

345
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.830
I can't waste a million yen like

346
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:30.930
this.

347
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.810
All right, let's all jump out at

348
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:34.910
the same time.

349
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:35.570
What?

350
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.650
The opponent is a machine.

351
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.610
I can't move fast.

352
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.190
While someone is being sacrificed, the others can

353
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.890
move on.

354
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.590
Interesting.

355
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:44.750
Listen.

356
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:46.450
Listen.

357
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.550
I don't care who gets killed.

358
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.350
Now, go!

359
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.210
While they're being attacked.

360
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.410
I knew it.

361
00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.850
You're all cheating.

362
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.030
I'm not cheating.

363
00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:08.750
All right, now.

364
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.230
I won't let you kill me alone.

365
00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:27.310
You're terrible, senpai.

366
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:28.450
You're in my way.

367
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:29.390
You're not my opponent.

368
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.150
Come on.

369
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.170
How's that?

370
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.110
You can't beat me directly.

371
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:40.470
Ryo.

372
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.070
Are you alive, boss?

373
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:44.930
I won't forgive you.

374
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.490
Damn it.

375
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.270
Wow.

376
00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.910
It sticks to the wall and moves on.

377
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.410
It's like a real cockroach.

378
00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:01.210
It's falling apart one

379
00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:10.190
by one.

380
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:11.610
All right.

381
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.170
Oh, no.

382
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.730
No.

383
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.410
I can't reach that far.

384
00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.790
Follow me.

385
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.290
Don't follow me.

386
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:28.170
You're just imitating me.

387
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.910
You're the one who's imitating

388
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:30.570
me.

389
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.130
You're a coward.

390
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.590
Senpai, you're done for.

391
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.330
I went all the way.

392
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.430
It's coming out of there.

393
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.070
It's more than a real cockroach.

394
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.870
You're pretty good, boss.

395
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.270
Boss, I have a present for you.

396
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.370
Now I've got a million yen.

397
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.960
There's nowhere to hide from now on.

398
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.620
It's hard to protect the goal.

399
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.140
I can't get close to it.

400
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.420
The goal is right in front of me.

401
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.800
The million yen is mine.

402
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.200
Ryo.

403
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.440
No, boss.

404
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.680
I won't forgive you.

405
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.080
Please calm down.

406
00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.240
It's a small one.

407
00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.540
What is it?

408
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.520
I found it.

409
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.700
I found it.

410
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.780
I'm almost at the goal.

411
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.680
I've come this far, and I've

412
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:13.780
been beaten.

413
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.120
All right, that's it.

414
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.440
It's disgusting.

415
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:21.460
I'm done.

416
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:21.720
It's coming.

417
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.480
I can't get down.

418
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.360
I've been crushed.

419
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.640
You've been crushed?

420
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.080
I'm done.

421
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.160
I'm not done yet.

422
00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.880
The million yen.

423
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.300
I've got a million yen.

424
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.740
I don't know what you're talking

425
00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:57.840
about.

426
00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.680
Now I've got it.

427
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.840
I'm going to be attacked someday.

428
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.160
It's a goal.

429
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:45.720
Yes.

430
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.640
I flew.

431
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.440
It's disgusting.

432
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.980
I'm going to attack.

433
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.120
I did it.

434
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.120
I got a million yen.

435
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.280
It's a million yen.

436
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.400
Boss, I told you.

437
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.880
It's no use paying money for athletics.

438
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.360
Don't you change your clothes?

439
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.000
I liked it, so I got it as

440
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.100
a souvenir.

441
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.740
I'll live as a cockroach for

442
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:29.840
the rest of my life.

443
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.160
Ryo, you did it.

444
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:34.680
Congratulations.

445
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.080
I knew you'd do it.

446
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.220
As promised.

447
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.680
The Kombu family is over there.

448
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.060
Take what you can.

449
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.420
I won't lose to anyone.

450
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.640
I've got a million yen.

451
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.860
It's a million yen.

452
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.940
I did it.

453
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.560
I've got a million yen.

454
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.680
What's this?

455
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.160
What's wrong?

456
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.860
Look at this.

457
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.640
Recently, on this island of dreams, there was

458
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.700
a witness who saw a huge cockroach.

459
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.340
And finally, we, the investigation team, managed to

460
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.980
capture it on camera.

461
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:31.900
Cockroach?

462
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.020
Please watch the shocking video.

463
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.880
A million yen.

464
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.740
I've got a million yen.

465
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.220
Damn it.

466
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.240
I've got a million yen.

467
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:06.680
What should I do?

468
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:07.300
I failed to build the picture

469
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.180
that the boss asked me to.

470
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.580
This is bad.

471
00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.900
I'll be in trouble if he finds

472
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.000
out.

473
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.520
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.280
I have to hide everything.

475
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.100
Next time, I'll recreate the movie, Road

476
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:19.420
Trip.

477
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:20.760
Don't miss it.

478
00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:35.380
Even if I stop the clock Time

479
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:42.660
will pass Don't look away Don't

480
00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.320
look away Let's live with a smile

481
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:57.820
Even if it rains today

482
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:07.240
Tomorrow will be sunny Bye bye Let's

483
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.360
wave our hands Let's say goodbye to

484
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:18.900
the bad things Let's live the way

485
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:27.860
we like Good things will happen The sun

486
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.220
is calling us outside the door
