's so cold.

18
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.170
How about some hot soba?

19
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.790
Sounds good.

20
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.350
It's so good.

21
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.630
It wasn't a popular place before.

22
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.210
Looks like we can get in soon.

23
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.590
Hey, watch out!

24
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.250
You bastard!

25
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.370
Senpai!

26
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.670
Huh?

27
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.510
This guy...

28
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.950
He's been appearing on TV and magazines

29
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.510
a lot lately.

30
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.890
He's a gourmet critic.

31
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.950
It's you, Chogoro.

32
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.730
This taste...

33
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.170
It's not ordinary.

34
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.350
Hmm...

35
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.070
There's always a shop that's not

36
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.530
ordinary.

37
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.230
Where's the owner?

38
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.690
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

39
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.450
Oh, this is...

40
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.730
Sensei, please come in.

41
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.590
Hey, you idiot!

42
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.150
You're breaking in!

43
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.030
You bastard!

44
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.610
Well, well, senpai.

45
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.470
Here you go.

46
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.710
Hmm...

47
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.170
It's not ordinary.

48
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.630
It looks like it's on the edge.

49
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.990
How arrogant.

50
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.810
We've been waiting under the cold sky

51
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.610
for three hours.

52
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.890
Hmm...

53
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.890
Shujin, this soba is not ordinary.

54
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.410
Oh, thank you very much.

55
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.450
Ohmaida-sensei

56
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.690
's not-ordinary-soba

57
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.890
is here.

58
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.050
I knew it.

59
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.810
This soba is top-notch.

60
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.710
It doesn't matter if it's not

61
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.930
ordinary or not.

62
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.090
After you finish eating, hurry up and sit

63
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.250
down.

64
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.170
Shujin, I'd like my acquaintance

65
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.670
to try this not-ordinary-

66
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.790
soba.

67
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.950
I'd like about 200 servings.

68
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.050
200 servings would cost more than 100,

69
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.810
000 yen.

70
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.510
Shujin, I'm Ohmaeda Ch

71
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.230
ougorou, the best gourmet critic

72
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.330
in Japan.

73
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.750
Of course, I don't need your treat.

74
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.950
Please enjoy your meal.

75
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.950
Keep up the good work.

76
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.670
Thank you very much.

77
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.030
Oh, it's finally gone.

78
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.290
Now, it's our turn.

79
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.090
What?

80
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.230
Hey, old man!

81
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.050
What do you mean by closed shop?

82
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.810
What do you mean by closed shop?

83
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.490
We wanted to eat hot soba, so

84
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.390
we've been waiting under this cold sky

85
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.290
for three hours.

86
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:18.890
Ohmaida-sensei took

87
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.709
all the soba.

88
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.370
What?

89
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.010
No way.

90
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.290
I'm the one who wants to lose.

91
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.010
I shouldn't have been put on this

92
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.110
magazine.

93
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.630
Damn it!

94
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.910
I see.

95
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.530
Because it was introduced in this magazine, the

96
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.370
number of customers suddenly increased.

97
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.850
So that's why.

98
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.650
He's eating soba to repay the

99
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.750
kindness.

100
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.210
He's a crazy guy.

101
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.830
Damn it!

102
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.790
I don't care if it's a

103
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.510
little bad.

104
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.270
Is there no place to eat hot so

105
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.370
ba?

106
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.630
Senpai, how about this soba shop?

107
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.990
What?

108
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.350
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.990
It's like there's no sign of

110
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.090
a customer.

111
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.590
There's no sign of a customer.

112
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.230
It's dangerous here.

113
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.850
Get out.

114
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.930
Why?

115
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.290
Don't you know?

116
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.630
It's not normal that it's not

117
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.730
so popular.

118
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.530
If you eat a lot, you'll get

119
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.370
a bad soba that you'll never

120
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.470
eat again.

121
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.470
Are you a customer?

122
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.730
That's what I meant.

123
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.210
Thank you.

124
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.890
What's wrong?

125
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.010
Actually, you're the fifth customer.

126
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.610
The fifth customer today?

127
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.430
I guess so.

128
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.870
It's not like that.

129
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.230
No, it's the fifth customer since I

130
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.590
started the shop.

131
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.070
What?

132
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.770
Wait a minute.

133
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.510
When did you start the shop?

134
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.790
Three years ago.

135
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.570
Three years ago?

136
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.490
I'll make it right away.

137
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.830
What would you like?

138
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.570
Actually, my stomach suddenly got weird.

139
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.050
Senpai, I feel sorry for you.

140
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.050
Let's eat.

141
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.750
Let's eat soba here.

142
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.250
If you eat soba here and your

143
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.170
stomach really gets weird, what are you going

144
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.310
to do?

145
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.970
If anything happens, I'll do something about

146
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.670
it with the medical team of the Nak

147
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.770
agawa Foundation.

148
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.150
Let's be the fifth customer.

149
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.970
Please.

150
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.330
All right, all right.

151
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.830
I'll be the fifth victim.

152
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.060
Thank you for waiting.

153
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.780
It looks like a bad soba.

154
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.880
That's right.

155
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.280
I'll eat it quickly and go back

156
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.560
to the exit.

157
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.880
Don't look at me.

158
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.500
I'm sorry.

159
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.000
You're worried about the customer's reaction,

160
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.960
aren't you?

161
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.180
Yes.

162
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.000
I'll let you know how I feel

163
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.200
after I finish eating.

164
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.680
So while I'm eating, go over there.

165
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.100
Yes.

166
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.480
It's a soba with no weird

167
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.700
ness.

168
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.020
It's not that bad that I can

169
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.120
't eat it.

170
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.640
This...

171
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.980
This is...

172
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.200
What's the matter, Nakagawa?

173
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.600
Boss, I have something to ask you.

174
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.720
Yes, what is it?

175
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.260
Could it be that this soba uses

176
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.500
the soba powder made on the Yam

177
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.900
ada Farm?

178
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.680
Yes, that's right.

179
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.380
What is the Yamada Farm?

180
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.100
You should know.

181
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.920
It is the farm of the master of

182
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.880
making soba powder, Mr. Yamada D

183
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.140
engoro.

184
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.520
The soba powder made here is said

185
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.980
to be the best in Japan, but it

186
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.940
is difficult to get it.

187
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.020
Even in the cooking department of

188
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.780
the Nakagawa Group, it is used

189
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.500
only in a very small part of the

190
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.820
shops.

191
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.780
I've known Mr. Yamada for a

192
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.200
long time, so he makes it cheap at

193
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.300
home.

194
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.200
I knew it.

195
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.580
And the soy sauce used in the soup

196
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.760
stock.

197
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.760
Isn't this made of sugar cane?

198
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.120
Yes.

199
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.100
Sugar cane, which has been made by hand

200
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.320
since the Tenpo era.

201
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.280
The traditional taste of Kishu, which

202
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.480
is said to be the birthplace of

203
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.580
soy sauce.

204
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.380
The soy sauce made here is called the

205
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.580
soy sauce in the soy sauce.

206
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.520
No, it's not just soy sauce.

207
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.800
Katsuobushi and kelp.

208
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.740
It is definitely a first-class product

209
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:08.840
to make this rich soup stock.

210
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.980
The leeks are also well packed and

211
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.180
use glossy things.

212
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.500
And the seven-spice pepper.

213
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.520
The seven flavors bring out an exquisite

214
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.160
harmony.

215
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.780
It also works well for the body.

216
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.880
I'm sure you're using a very

217
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.960
well-chosen material.

218
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.500
Hey, hey.

219
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.020
How can you use such a great material

220
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.620
to make such ordinary soba?

221
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.320
It's normal.

222
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.620
Senpai, look at your bowl.

223
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.919
Huh?

224
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:33.580
Huh?

225
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.370
When did you...

226
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.500
That's what a really delicious thing is.

227
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.480
It goes into your body naturally.

228
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.780
Oh, dad.

229
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.020
I'd like another drink.

230
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.780
Yes.

231
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.380
Well, it's pretty good when you taste

232
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.440
it carefully.

233
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.220
Right?

234
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.480
It's got this much flavor.

235
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.080
Promote it more.

236
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.780
I'm not good at flashy things.

237
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.820
That's weird, though.

238
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.780
With this much flavor, the customers are likely

239
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.160
to come with a mouthful.

240
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.620
But there's a deep reason why customers

241
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:06.720
don't come.

242
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:07.920
A deep reason?

243
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.680
A deep reason?

244
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.440
Three years ago, I can't forget.

245
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.140
One day, when it was snowing lightly,

246
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.360
this shop opened.

247
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.660
I was nervous and waiting for the first

248
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.380
customer to come.

249
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.620
Then...

250
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.180
I'm sorry.

251
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.980
What?

252
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.680
It was you?

253
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.560
Was it you, Sensei?

254
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.880
Did you come all the way to eat?

255
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.760
No, I came to use the bathroom.

256
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.100
So, this was a soba shop.

257
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.260
I didn't notice it because it was

258
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:45.360
so plain.

259
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.680
It's just right.

260
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.900
Let's have lunch here.

261
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.380
Yes, I'll make it right away.

262
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.960
Anyway, it was my first customer, so I

263
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.260
put a lot of effort into making it.

264
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.720
Here you go.

265
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:22.250
H-How

266
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.670
was it?

267
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.210
It was just plain.

268
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.410
It's delicious.

269
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.110
It's a special taste.

270
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.410
Is that so?

271
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.090
Um...

272
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.350
It'll be 700 yen, but...

273
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.510
Master, you don't know who I am,

274
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:39.890
do you?

275
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.450
I'm the gourmet critic, Choug

276
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:43.790
oro Omaeda.

277
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.410
Yes.

278
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.350
So, one bowl of kakesoba will

279
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.990
be 700 yen.

280
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.330
I'm the gourmet critic, Choug

281
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:52.610
oro Omaeda.

282
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.250
So, one bowl of kakesoba will

283
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.990
be 700 yen.

284
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.710
I'm the gourmet critic, Choug

285
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.810
oro Omaeda.

286
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.750
So, 700 yen...

287
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.990
I said I'm the gourmet critic,

288
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.550
Chougoro Omaeda.

289
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.510
It's 700 yen.

290
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.650
Unfortunately, I don't have any cash with

291
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.750
me.

292
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.170
Can you give me a break with this?

293
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.030
It's pure gold, so it should be

294
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.770
worth 20,000 to 30,000 yen.

295
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.870
Thank you.

296
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.390
Thank you.

297
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.170
Master, what is the name of this restaurant?

298
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.110
It's Tanaka Soba.

299
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.410
Tanaka Soba.

300
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.730
I'll remember that.

301
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.270
In the end, the mannenshit

302
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.250
su was a fake.

303
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.370
That's a big story.

304
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.610
I was surprised a week later.

305
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.390
He was mocking our restaurant.

306
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.650
He was mocking our restaurant.

307
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.470
It's not for humans to eat.

308
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.210
Even if the world forgives it, I

309
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:51.770
won't forgive it.

310
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.330
Minus seven points.

311
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.590
That's terrible.

312
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:55.650
Don't display things like this.

313
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.870
But our restaurant is being introduced.

314
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.870
It's only a negative image.

315
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.890
Even so, it's a terrible article.

316
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.470
It's all about criticism.

317
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.930
I couldn't eat it for free.

318
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.350
I couldn't eat it for free.

319
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.530
I can't believe it.

320
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.130
I can't believe it.

321
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.870
It's strange that a person who doesn

322
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.090
't know the taste of food is a

323
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.810
food critic.

324
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.990
I'll show you what happens if you

325
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.090
make me angry.

326
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.730
Do you agree, Master?

327
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:26.450
Yes.

328
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.110
If I can...

329
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.970
Leave it to me.

330
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.170
I have a good idea.

331
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.090
I'll make you pay.

332
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.490
I'll make you pay.

333
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:42.020
In order to make you pay, you need

334
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:42.800
to make a sacrifice.

335
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.260
We need a plan.

336
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.480
Are you ready?

337
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.080
Y-Yes.

338
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.200
Then let's start the plan to make

339
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.420
Omaeda Chogorou say,

340
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:48.780
Gyafun!

341
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.720
W-What are you doing?

342
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.840
We can't let an ordinary store like

343
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.280
this be the subject of an old-

344
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.380
fashioned critique.

345
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.600
We need a plan and a plan B!

346
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.720
I see.

347
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.220
You're trying to make it look like

348
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.680
you've been enduring the wind and snow

349
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:07.900
for years.

350
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.400
That's right.

351
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800
Gyafun!

352
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.040
We can't let an ordinary store like

353
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.580
this be the subject of an old-

354
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:23.680
fashioned critique.

355
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.320
Gyafun!

356
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.080
My store...

357
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.540
Senpai, is there anything I can do

358
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:31.800
to help?

359
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.800
Yes, anything is fine.

360
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.200
Bring me something that will give the store

361
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.720
a sense of tradition and traditionality.

362
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.080
Understood!

363
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.220
Here it is!

364
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.940
Next up...

365
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.900
Ryo!

366
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.900
You're just in time.

367
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.500
I believe you made a bowl at the

368
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.400
school's school festival.

369
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.460
Yes, but it's covered in dust

370
00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.160
and it's cracked.

371
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.220
That's even more convenient.

372
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.540
Bring that over.

373
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.320
Borrow some for your friend.

374
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.300
Got it, Ryo!

375
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:05.400
Senpai!

376
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.780
You're up!

377
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.700
I borrowed this from a museum all over

378
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:37.800
the world.

379
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.260
It's a collection of stories about the

380
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:39.880
history of mankind.

381
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.820
Very well.

382
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:42.980
Um...

383
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.520
I don't think it's right to

384
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.000
have something like this It's fine.

385
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:47.960
It's better to have something like this.

386
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.720
That's right.

387
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.460
Let's call this the anniversary of Cle

388
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.560
opatra's return.

389
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.340
This is crazy!

390
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:57.680
It's a mess!

391
00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.280
I guess this is fine.

392
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.420
Let's break a pillar.

393
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.320
Please don't!

394
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.440
If you cut this, the building itself will

395
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:07.740
break!

396
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.420
That's true.

397
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.080
Ryo!

398
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.200
I'm back!

399
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.970
Good, good.

400
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.570
You did well.

401
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.890
Now the store is okay.

402
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.710
All that's left is...

403
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.930
No, no way!

404
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.170
Please don't!

405
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.370
Please don't do that!

406
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:27.090
Please don't do that!

407
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.890
It's not right to take such a

408
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:30.990
place!

409
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.150
Please don't do that!

410
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:32.690
Don't say that!

411
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.810
That bicycle...

412
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.950
You're slacking off again, aren't

413
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:44.410
you, Kankichi?

414
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.230
Hey!

415
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.630
Mr. Nakagawa!

416
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:47.810
It's over.

417
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.950
Come on.

418
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.330
But...

419
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.230
Why are you embarrassed?

420
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.290
You're slacking off again, aren't

421
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:53.450
you?

422
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.310
I'm going to tell Chief Ohara.

423
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:55.850
Hey!

424
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:56.690
Hey!

425
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.860
Pervert.

426
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.660
I...

427
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.400
I see.

428
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.220
Are you that happy?

429
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.940
I'm lamenting the misfortune of

430
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.040
my god.

431
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.700
Now the stage is ready.

432
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.660
Nakagawa.

433
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.300
Arrange the cherry blossoms.

434
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.460
Yes.

435
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.560
All that's left is to drive the

436
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.620
prey in.

437
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:38.330
Is there really a good soba restaurant

438
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.130
Yes.

439
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.730
According to the information from the

440
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.690
viewers, you can line up 2kg of

441
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:43.830
food every day.

442
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:45.830
Isn't that it?

443
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.540
That's amazing.

444
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.660
Is this the line that goes all the

445
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.060
way to the soba restaurant?

446
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.950
Today, I'd like to interview the best

447
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.710
gourmet critic in Japan, Mr. Ohma

448
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.130
eda Chogorou, about this ph

449
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:21.670
antom soba restaurant.

450
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.810
I'm Ohmaeda Chogor

451
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:24.930
ou.

452
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.590
Who are you guys?

453
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.850
We heard that Mr. Ohmaeda is

454
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:30.610
going to interview this restaurant.

455
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:32.810
Would you like to join us?

456
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.030
Yes.

457
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.830
Don't get in the way.

458
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.610
Sir, what is your first impression of this

459
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:41.710
restaurant?

460
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.970
Hey, do you know?

461
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.330
This restaurant has been in business for 20

462
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.230
years.

463
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.310
Yes.

464
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.850
There's also a rumor that it's

465
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:51.870
designated as a national cultural property.

466
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.690
A national cultural property?

467
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.570
This restaurant must have been run by the

468
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:00.750
manager.

469
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.610
When the Meiji Earthqu

470
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.090
ake struck, there was a fierce battle between

471
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.970
the Ishin Army and the Bak

472
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.450
ufu Army in front of this restaurant.

473
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.390
There's no doubt about it.

474
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.550
Even though it's a wound from a

475
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:13.650
senior?

476
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.130
It's surprisingly easy to be fooled.

477
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.630
This mirror has been placed here

478
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.730
for no reason.

479
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.110
It's a piece that makes you feel

480
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.410
the history of Yu-G

481
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:19.550
i-Oh!

482
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.770
This restaurant isn't ordinary.

483
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:23.890
It's not ordinary!

484
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.790
It's not ordinary!

485
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.750
I'm so excited!

486
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.210
Excuse me.

487
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.030
You idiot!

488
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.650
Get out of here!

489
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.050
In our restaurant, we only use chili peppers

490
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.410
once.

491
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.050
You used it twice!

492
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.950
Tell the manager to get out of here!

493
00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:49.870
What are you doing?

494
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.650
Hurry up!

495
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.990
Are you really going to leave like this?

496
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.270
Of course!

497
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.590
Get ready!

498
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.070
Because of the article he wrote, only five

499
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.170
people came in three years.

500
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.770
Only five customers came.

501
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.710
Remember that!

502
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.210
Go!

503
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.670
I'm sorry, manager.

504
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:13.770
Manager.

505
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.150
If you don't keep the restaurant's

506
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.630
reputation, you're not a customer!

507
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:24.730
Don't come back!

508
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:25.790
Wow!

509
00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:26.730
It's a shop dedicated to craftsmen.

510
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.950
What do you think, Mr. Omaeda?

511
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.790
With his current condition, he must have kicked

512
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.450
out people from the British royal family.

513
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:34.530
Yes.

514
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.190
But now he's back, and now he

515
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.370
's selling it to Buckingham Palace

516
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:38.810
every week.

517
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.350
The British royal family?

518
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.810
He's trying to protect the taste of

519
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:47.110
soba noodles.

520
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.510
And look at this owner!

521
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.590
He's wearing a traditional geta, but

522
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.990
he's still sticking to the trad

523
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.110
ition.

524
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.510
He's actively adopting a Western style.

525
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.650
It's like a combination of the East

526
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:58.170
and the West.

527
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.910
The owner of the restaurant is not an

528
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.210
ordinary person!

529
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.510
He's not an ordinary person again!

530
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.750
Why?

531
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.070
Why are you guys here?

532
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:09.850
Don't you know me?

533
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.570
I'm Mr. Omaeda, a gour

534
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:12.670
met critic.

535
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.870
I'm here for a TV interview.

536
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.450
What?

537
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.310
A TV interview?

538
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.790
Idiot!

539
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:18.810
Don't do an interview!

540
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.930
If you broadcast on TV, people who don

541
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.110
't know the taste of soba noodles

542
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.390
will come to you.

543
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.610
If we get more customers, we'll be

544
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:26.930
busy!

545
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.710
Hey!

546
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.490
Don't shoot me!

547
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:30.570
Customers are customers!

548
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.430
We just serve soba noodles as usual!

549
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:34.390
Yes, sir.

550
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:38.210
Wonderful!

551
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.950
I've eaten all kinds of food from

552
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.690
all over the world, but this is the

553
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.110
first time I've eaten so delicious so

554
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.590
ba noodles!

555
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.710
I'll leave my feelings here!

556
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.090
As expected, the head of the United Nations

557
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.730
office is just a regular customer.

558
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.030
If you call this bad, you're not

559
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:56.550
human.

560
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.690
The head of the United Nations office!

561
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.180
Hey, Mr. Omaeda.

562
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.300
Well, how about the taste of the essential

563
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.700
soba?

564
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.290
I'm hungry.

565
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.460
The texture of the soba, the way

566
00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.100
to make the broth, the way to cut

567
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.720
the green onions, and even this artistic bowl!

568
00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.100
I made it.

569
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.800
Which one do you want?

570
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.640
Nine items!

571
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.520
It's not just anything.

572
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.720
I, Mr. Omaeda Chogoro,

573
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.920
will give you the seven stars as proof

574
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.020
that it's not just anything!

575
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.540
You're happy, too, aren't you?

576
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.200
Hey, you!

577
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:05.900
What's going on?

578
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.120
What are you doing?

579
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:08.820
You're so rude!

580
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:09.880
Shut up!

581
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.900
Look at this!

582
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.420
Tanaka Soba?

583
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.280
Don't you remember even when you look

584
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:18.380
at this?

585
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.840
What's this place?

586
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.880
You finally remember.

587
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.060
That's right.

588
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.380
You're the Tanaka Soba who

589
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.780
gave you the minus seven stars three years

590
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:27.880
ago!

591
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.360
What's going on?

592
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.220
Nothing has changed here since three years ago.

593
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.920
We've been using the best ingredients to

594
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.360
make the best soba ever!

595
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.040
Is that so?

596
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.900
You're the one who confessed.

597
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.860
You really don't know the taste of

598
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:47.960
soba!

599
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.860
Oh, no!

600
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.120
You don't deserve to be called a

601
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:52.800
gourmet critic!

602
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.420
You're just a bad taster!

603
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.140
Mr. Tanaka!

604
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.120
Is what you just said true?

605
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.940
Please explain, Mr. Tanaka!

606
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.180
N-No comment!

607
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.640
Mr. Tanaka!

608
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.760
The operation was a huge success!

609
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.200
The phantom soba restaurant was a

610
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.620
success, but Ohmaeda was a failure!

611
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.300
Mr. Tanaka's soba restaurant seems

612
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.180
to be doing well.

613
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.600
Yeah.

614
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.660
But Mr. Ohmaeda hasn't come

615
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.520
back since then.

616
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.840
Huh?

617
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.420
What's the matter?

618
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.700
A mysterious gourmet critic has appeared.

619
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.260
Recently, people who claim to be gourmet

620
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.920
critics have appeared in the city.

621
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.820
They come to each house and eat together.

622
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.980
That's Mr. Ohmaeda, isn't

623
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:43.080
it?

624
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.180
That's him!

625
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.980
He's not an ordinary person!

626
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.950
Real study is not just about remembering

627
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:08.350
things.

628
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.390
It's about being useful in life.

629
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.050
I'll teach you how to enjoy studying

630
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:14.590
by using your body.

631
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.350
Next on Gyoza Style.

632
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.470
The Must-Win Test!

633
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.710
Please watch it!

634
00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:02.520
