(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) The wind of the changing

2
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:25.050
seasons blows and the brightest sun shines

3
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.450
Lightly passing through the rough times A

4
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.210
finger pointing to the future alone I wanna

5
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.050
time is a paradise So that I can

6
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.570
find all the popular things I'm gonna

7
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.850
take the most honest one Ready, set, go!

8
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.710
Everybody can do!

9
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.010
The dream I started running always doesn't

10
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:06.070
stop I won't regret tomorrow Everybody can

11
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.270
do!

12
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.670
Even if it's just a little bit,

13
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.350
I don't want to see it I

14
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.050
'm gonna take the most honest one I

15
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:29.540
'm gonna take the most honest one The

16
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.800
most irresponsible parent and child in Japan It

17
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:43.530
's cold,

18
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.630
isn't it?

19
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.910
If it's cold like this, I don

20
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.370
't want to go on patrol.

21
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.750
Ryo-chan, why are you saying

22
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.030
that?

23
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.430
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.270
There's a letter for Ryo-

25
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.430
chan.

26
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.610
It's a mail order, isn't it?

27
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.130
I don't think it's a mail

28
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.330
order.

29
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.350
It's from Ryo-tsu

30
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.870
and Yone-san.

31
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.950
What?

32
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.390
Ryo-san, isn't it Y

33
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.389
one-san and Fukura-san?

34
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.350
I don't know.

35
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.760
Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

36
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.780
It's worse than a mail order.

37
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.300
It's worse than a mail order.

38
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.380
I'm going on patrol.

39
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.800
Dear Kankichi, My mother is fine.

40
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.600
No matter how much I send a letter,

41
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060
she doesn't answer.

42
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.980
It's a good news that she doesn

43
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.060
't rely on me, but I'm so

44
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.780
sad that I haven't heard from her

45
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.880
for years.

46
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.960
My father has been sick since last year,

47
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.420
and he has become very weak.

48
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.240
Recently, he has been sleeping all day.

49
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.980
Kankichi, don't be stubborn.

50
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.900
Just show him your face once.

51
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.980
If you do that, I'm sure your

52
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.400
father will be fine.

53
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.580
It's a bad omen, so please

54
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.120
come back.

55
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.260
Mother, please don't catch a cold.

56
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.880
Ryo-chan, wait a minute.

57
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.880
What is it?

58
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.560
Why don't you go home?

59
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.420
Shut up!

60
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.900
I hate to be scolded and lectured.

61
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.560
Bye.

62
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.320
Ryo-chan!

63
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.100
Stop it.

64
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.840
If you talk about your family, you'll

65
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.400
be in a bad mood.

66
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720
By the way, you've never talked about

67
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.320
your family.

68
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.980
There's something I can't tell you.

69
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.240
Chief!

70
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.380
Ryo!

71
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.480
Chief, what is it that you can't

72
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.920
tell me?

73
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.080
I don't know the details, but when

74
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.100
I was 18 years old, I had a

75
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.500
big fight with my father and ran away

76
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.620
from home.

77
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.460
I haven't been home since then.

78
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.180
So you haven't been home for years?

79
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.740
No.

80
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.360
I used to go home because I was

81
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.460
stubborn.

82
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.800
I thought you went back to Shib

83
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.380
abata, but it was useless.

84
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.860
You said you had a beautiful sister, and

85
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.140
you wanted to get rid of her.

86
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.280
By the way, you said you didn't

87
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280
like to be scolded and lectured.

88
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.860
Every year, after the end of

89
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.600
the lunar calendar, a lot of scoldings

90
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.980
from my family are sent to the office.

91
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.820
With a letter saying, thank you for taking

92
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.399
care of Kankichi.

93
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.820
Ryo-chan has such a wonderful

94
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.260
family.

95
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.580
Ryo-chan has such a wonderful

96
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.680
family.

97
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.900
By the way, why don't you make

98
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.380
Ryo-chan and your father reconcile?

99
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.200
It's a good idea, isn't it?

100
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.440
If you do that, your mother won't

101
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.080
have to write such a letter.

102
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.200
Stop it.

103
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.660
Stop it.

104
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.460
If you get involved in Ryotsu

105
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.020
's affairs, it won't be good for

106
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.360
you.

107
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.740
Damn it!

108
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.300
Someone's talking behind my back.

109
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.460
What are you doing?

110
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.000
You seem to be in good shape today,

111
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.280
so I thought I'd pay you a

112
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.380
visit.

113
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.260
Wait a minute.

114
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.820
You don't need a horse-r

115
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.340
iding newspaper, do you?

116
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.740
Oh, this is...

117
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.780
You can't just lie down and be

118
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.920
stupid.

119
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.860
It's called head exercise.

120
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.980
See you.

121
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.620
Dad!

122
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.180
Damn it!

123
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.640
I was so happy to get the Man

124
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.080
ba ticket, but I was surprised.

125
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.620
What?

126
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.680
Senpai, please wake up.

127
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.880
There's something I want to show you.

128
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.620
Something you want to show me?

129
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.620
What is it?

130
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.460
It's just a navigation system.

131
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.640
That's not the navigation system of Son

132
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.160
jo-Sokora.

133
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.360
What?

134
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.440
It's a super-navigation

135
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.600
system built by our company.

136
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.860
Traffic information, of course.

137
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.140
Every house and building in Japan, as well

138
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.960
as date spots and food spots, are all

139
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.440
inputted.

140
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.880
You even have such a detailed map?

141
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.560
Then let's set up a destination and

142
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.240
start the navigation system.

143
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.080
Is there anywhere you want to go?

144
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.720
I haven't been to Asakusa

145
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.000
since I came to Tokyo.

146
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.360
Let's go to Asakusa.

147
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.120
Don't go there.

148
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.100
Let's go somewhere else.

149
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.140
Why?

150
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.300
No reason.

151
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.080
Anyway, don't go to Asakusa.

152
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.840
I see.

153
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.980
I feel like Asakusa is a

154
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.600
place I can't get out of.

155
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.040
That's right.

156
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.180
There's no place to play in As

157
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.280
akusa.

158
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.520
It's just old men and old women.

159
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.460
It's lame.

160
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.680
It's lame.

161
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.840
That's right.

162
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.680
There's nothing to see.

163
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.180
Let's go to Roppongi

164
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.760
or Shibuya.

165
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.320
Are you kidding me?

166
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.860
Asakusa is lame?

167
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.560
Stop joking around.

168
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.620
What?

169
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.040
Asakusa has been the center of

170
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.140
culture since the Edo period.

171
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.500
Compared to Asakusa, Roppong

172
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.500
i and Shibuya are nothing.

173
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.240
But Ryo...

174
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.840
Shut up!

175
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.920
There's nothing to see?

176
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.100
That's great.

177
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.280
I'll show you what's great about

178
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.640
Asakusa.

179
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.020
I'll show you what's great about

180
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.120
Asakusa.

181
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.880
I'll show you.

182
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.260
Good morning.

183
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.300
Let's start the route guide.

184
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.140
Who's that?

185
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.340
It's the popular voice actress, Maya K

186
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.740
atsuragi.

187
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.120
Ryo, go with Maya to Asak

188
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.220
usa.

189
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.760
I will.

190
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.140
I don't want to talk to Nav

191
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.240
i.

192
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.580
I talked to Navi.

193
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.180
If you input her name, she'll guide

194
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.160
you so you can talk to her.

195
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.280
By the way, this is the popular voice

196
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.800
actress version.

197
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.280
There are many other versions.

198
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.360
Don't look at me like that.

199
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.300
You'll surprise me.

200
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.520
What is this software?

201
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.540
It's pretty good.

202
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.460
It's the AV actress version.

203
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.280
Change it to something else!

204
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.860
Oh no!

205
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.720
I was supposed to turn left at the

206
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.040
intersection.

207
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.860
Why did you turn left?

208
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.240
You idiot!

209
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.840
Katsu!

210
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.620
It's Navi!

211
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.180
Ryo, calm down.

212
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.020
What are you going to do if you

213
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.540
get hit by Navi?

214
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.560
I don't think the Yakuza

215
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.900
version suits you.

216
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.990
Ryo, what is this?

217
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.430
Don't you know about thunder?

218
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.250
You look pretty scared.

219
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.090
What is this?

220
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.470
This is thunder.

221
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.770
This is wind.

222
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.710
If you go through this shop, you'll

223
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.090
get to the battlefield.

224
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.710
It's a weekday morning, but it

225
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.270
's pretty busy.

226
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.010
It's a lot less than before.

227
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.850
It's good when it's fresh

228
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:50.950
ly made.

229
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.930
Ryo!

230
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.870
It's Ryo!

231
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.010
I want to eat this, too.

232
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.570
I want to eat this, too.

233
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.430
It's Ryo!

234
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.010
It's Kan-chan!

235
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.150
How are you?

236
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.090
It's been a while.

237
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.670
Kan-chan is back.

238
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.150
Oh, Kankichi!

239
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.090
It's been a while.

240
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.430
Hey, old man.

241
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.230
You're drinking and making Kami-

242
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.490
san cry, aren't you?

243
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.530
I'm glad you're back.

244
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.510
It's been a while, hasn't it?

245
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.570
I was looking forward to closing the shop

246
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.810
in three days.

247
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.330
What?

248
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.870
It's been a while, hasn't it?

249
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.770
It's been years, but you're still

250
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.170
popular.

251
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.790
This place is like a garden to you,

252
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.890
isn't it?

253
00:09:43.690 --> 00:10:00.190
Do you

254
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.770
want to go to Disneyland in downtown?

255
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.430
Disneyland in downtown?

256
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.750
Yeah!

257
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.030
Yeah!

258
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.890
This roller coaster is full of thrill.

259
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.770
I feel like I'm going to break

260
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.730
into a house.

261
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.930
By the way, Ryo's parents' house

262
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.770
is near here, isn't it?

263
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.590
I want to see it.

264
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.130
I'm not kidding.

265
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.650
We're on a business trip.

266
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.150
We're going back.

267
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.650
I didn't know there was a word

268
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.250
for business trip in Ryo's dictionary.

269
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.210
Shut up!

270
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.570
I haven't been back for years.

271
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.870
I forgot where I was.

272
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.970
Don't worry about that.

273
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.110
I have a navigation system.

274
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.190
What?

275
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.910
I came all the way here.

276
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.070
It's like coming to Asakusa

277
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.870
and not paying a visit during the war.

278
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.490
Is that so?

279
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.590
You guys are stuck.

280
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.210
Hey, let me go!

281
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.770
Oh, that's Ryo's house.

282
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:04.430
Now that we're here, let's go

283
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.130
inside.

284
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.930
What are you talking about?

285
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.710
We came all the way here, so we

286
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.070
should show our faces.

287
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.350
Look, isn't that Ryo's mother?

288
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.780
Hey, senpai.

289
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.540
You idiot!

290
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.600
Ever since you fought with your father at

291
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.480
the store at the age of 18, I

292
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:24.640
've decided that I'll never go to

293
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.400
a funeral again.

294
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.660
But your father seems to be sleeping sound

295
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.760
ly.

296
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.440
You should pay a visit to him.

297
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.840
I was so moved that I cut the

298
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.020
kite.

299
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.480
I can't go back now.

300
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.180
I'll walk home.

301
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.960
Ryo!

302
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.620
You came all the way here.

303
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.860
Senpai, do you want to eat something?

304
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.400
I'll treat you.

305
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.060
Oh, really?

306
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.740
If you're going to treat me, that

307
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.140
's a different story.

308
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.240
Oh, it's delicious.

309
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.920
Yeah, it's like chomorog

310
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.100
u.

311
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.340
It's not just delicious.

312
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.360
The price is also very cheap.

313
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.720
That's true.

314
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.400
This taste and volume are more than doubled

315
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:10.740
in Ginga.

316
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.000
What do you think, Reiko?

317
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.080
Have you seen Asakusa again?

318
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.020
Yes, yes, I saw it.

319
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.780
I see, I see.

320
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.700
Asakusa is the best after all.

321
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.120
Asakusa is the best?

322
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.220
Are you stupid?

323
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.720
I'm sure of it.

324
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.480
If you come to such an ugl

325
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.560
y place, Katsudon Kashi

326
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.640
will be surprised and open a cannon.

327
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.740
This is my favorite place after all, but

328
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.840
if it's Tokyo, it's Ropp

329
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.100
ongi.

330
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.440
It's Roppongi!

331
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.240
Ryo!

332
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.480
Hey, if you listen quietly, you'll be

333
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.820
in a good mood.

334
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.580
Hey, old man.

335
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.000
It's been a long time since you

336
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.400
've been to Asakusa.

337
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.760
Even if Lord Kannon allows it, I

338
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.260
won't allow it!

339
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.300
Who are you to interfere with my plans?

340
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.560
You are...

341
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.280
Ryo, I'm sure that was...

342
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.340
Shh, shut up.

343
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.260
What's wrong?

344
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.020
Does that person look familiar?

345
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.580
Well, I do know him.

346
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.980
That person was also called Ryo.

347
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.600
There are a lot of people like that

348
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:36.700
around here.

349
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.740
Well, that's fine.

350
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.620
Could it be your father?

351
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.680
No!

352
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.560
Then who is it?

353
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.520
Well, it's...

354
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.900
It's the wife of that person who

355
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.180
gave birth to me 40 years ago.

356
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.940
It's your father, isn't it?

357
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.100
Well, that's what people say.

358
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.180
Kei-chan, you did it!

359
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.820
Now, Ryo-chan, let's say

360
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.160
hello.

361
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.900
Shh, not now.

362
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.600
Later, later.

363
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.820
It's not too late now.

364
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.580
That's right, senpai!

365
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.860
Now, come on.

366
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.560
It's kind of noisy around here.

367
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.020
Senpai, hurry up!

368
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.940
Senpai, you're here!

369
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.560
Hello, nice to meet you.

370
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:19.960
My name is Keiichi Nakag

371
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.180
awa.

372
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.860
I'm always in your care, senpai.

373
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.920
My name is Reiko Akimoto.

374
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.020
Nice to meet you.

375
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.760
Nice to meet you, too.

376
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.360
Are you okay?

377
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.680
Well, I'm fine.

378
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240
What are you doing?

379
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.300
You're a parent, aren't you?

380
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.100
At least say hello.

381
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.320
Ryo-chan!

382
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.320
Senpai!

383
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:44.900
Okay.

384
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.160
H-Hello.

385
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.800
I'm your son, Ryo-ts

386
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:49.900
u.

387
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.240
Do you remember me?

388
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.800
Oh, it's you.

389
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.520
I thought I saw your face somewhere.

390
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.320
You're talking nonsense.

391
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.120
Are you really a parent?

392
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.420
I'm starting to lose confidence, too.

393
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.500
It's been a while.

394
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.840
Sorry to bother you.

395
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.300
Ryo-tsu, I'm leaving.

396
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.820
Oh, wait!

397
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.540
There's more!

398
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
The main race starts with a roll call.

399
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.580
It's perfect!

400
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
Okay, take your time.

401
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.840
Thank you very much.

402
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.920
I didn't know Asakusa No.

403
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.480
1 was going to race.

404
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.960
Don't be ridiculous.

405
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:47.530
Ryo-chan, say something.

406
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.870
It's been a while.

407
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.110
Oh, um...

408
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.450
Is your wife making tsukudani?

409
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.590
Oh, thank you.

410
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.150
You should talk to your father.

411
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.010
He's embarrassed.

412
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:05.650
Is that so?

413
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.690
Um...

414
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.770
Recently, the police...

415
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.570
The media...

416
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.710
They're all talking about me.

417
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.210
It must be hard for otakus,

418
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.990
too.

419
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.270
No.

420
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.910
They've already given up on you.

421
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.890
It's like you're a matchmaker.

422
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.410
I don't think it's a conversation

423
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.510
between a father and son.

424
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.850
I can't stand this air!

425
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.410
I can't let my dad leave the

426
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:47.790
store...

427
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.350
and expect a race in a place like

428
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.450
this.

429
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.730
If he's sick, he should just stay

430
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.390
at home.

431
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.250
What did you say?

432
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.110
I can't stand this air!

433
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.050
I can't let my dad leave the

434
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.730
store...

435
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.829
and expect a race in a place like

436
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.929
this.

437
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.670
You're to blame for Asakusa

438
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:06.790
No.

439
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.530
1.

440
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.470
You said you'd never come to As

441
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.410
akusa again.

442
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.010
You said you wanted to come, so you

443
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.150
came.

444
00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.810
I don't know.

445
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.250
I'm sorry to bother you.

446
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.589
Let's go somewhere else.

447
00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:24.730
Excuse me!

448
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:26.130
Yes!

449
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.110
What a great father and son.

450
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.810
I can't keep up with them.

451
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.570
I can't drink this.

452
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:41.990
It's got a B-ball.

453
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.890
You can drink Ramune by stopping the

454
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:48.350
B-ball.

455
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.610
Is that so?

456
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.350
Well, that's how it is.

457
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.010
He's a tough guy, too.

458
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.130
Well, now that I think about it, I

459
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.990
don't think I'm that mature.

460
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.350
It's your dad's fault for making

461
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.670
you eat so much tsukudani.

462
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.690
When you were in elementary school, you had

463
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.310
a nickname called Tsukudani T

464
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.490
aro.

465
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.570
That's why.

466
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.910
It's so that you can get nut

467
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.270
rition and grow up quickly.

468
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.410
You're going to be a nutrition master

469
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.410
every day in Tsukudani, aren

470
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:12.610
't you?

471
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.490
Anyway, just make a joke of your face.

472
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.010
You've got a face like this.

473
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.190
Have you ever been told about your face?

474
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.630
What did you say?

475
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.830
I don't know anything about this rotten

476
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.350
thing.

477
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.710
How dare you say that to your parents?

478
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:26.710
I'll do it.

479
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.350
Damn it.

480
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.790
It's a fire!

481
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.370
It's a fire!

482
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:39.530
It's a fire!

483
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.190
It's a fire!

484
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.070
Come on, come on, come on.

485
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.550
Hey, wait, old man.

486
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.730
They're just like their parents.

487
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.530
Hey, look, look.

488
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.110
Hey, look, look.

489
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.590
Isn't the fire truck coming yet?

490
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.570
It's a big deal.

491
00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.290
It looks like the old lady is still

492
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:08.870
in the room.

493
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.830
Where is she?

494
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.630
She's at the end of the second

495
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.870
floor.

496
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.410
Is it over there?

497
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:15.630
Mr. Taiki!

498
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.050
Oh!

499
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:18.210
Kakichi!

500
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.370
I'm going to save that boy's

501
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.550
sister.

502
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.050
You take care of the old lady.

503
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.710
Why am I the old lady?

504
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.470
Wait, old man!

505
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.250
Why am I...

506
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.630
Boy's sister.

507
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.230
Why am I...

508
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.250
Boy's boy.

509
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.410
Old lady, are you okay?

510
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.150
What's wrong?

511
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.090
I sprained my ankle.

512
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.050
Now, sister.

513
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:41.990
I'm sorry.

514
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.270
I can't stand it.

515
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.930
Let's go, sister.

516
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.290
Dad!

517
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.150
What are you doing?

518
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.670
Hurry up!

519
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.450
I sprained my ankle.

520
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.790
Hurry up!

521
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.990
Sister!

522
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:01.670
Grab my shoulder!

523
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.070
Yes!

524
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:04.930
Dad!

525
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:05.950
I'll be right back.

526
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:06.710
Wait for me!

527
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.590
Yes!

528
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:25.900
Take care of these

529
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.080
two.

530
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:26.780
Yes!

531
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:27.840
Ryo!

532
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.620
Senpai!

533
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.640
What are you doing?

534
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.900
Senpai!

535
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.720
What are you doing?

536
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.780
I don't have time to explain!

537
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.360
You're more dangerous than this!

538
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.440
Leave it to us.

539
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.680
Shut up!

540
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:40.680
Move!

541
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.000
I told you no!

542
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:42.880
Let me go!

543
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.920
My dad is climbing!

544
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.680
Senpai!

545
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.640
Senpai!

546
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.100
What is Kankichi doing?

547
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.220
Damn it!

548
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.280
I should have asked him for a bucket.

549
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.660
Don't be stupid!

550
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.080
You can't swim in this sea!

551
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:15.760
Damn it!

552
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.280
Kankichi!

553
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.940
It's hot!

554
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.920
Ryo!

555
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.400
Senpai!

556
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.920
No way!

557
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.410
Senpai!

558
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.130
I'm worried about you!

559
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.190
I'm not going to die!

560
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.550
I'm not going to die!

561
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.230
Reiko, be nice to him.

562
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.150
I'm sorry.

563
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.550
You don't have to apologize.

564
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.010
It's normal for him to act like

565
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.110
this.

566
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.470
I'm not going to listen to you.

567
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.230
What did you say?

568
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.970
Reiko, Kankichi was a girl

569
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:16.430
until 3rd grade.

570
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.390
That's enough!

571
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.150
Who do you think saved his life?

572
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.850
Who do you think saved his life?

573
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.630
Who did you say saved his life?

574
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.710
I was able to escape on my own.

575
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:25.550
Why did you have to do that?

576
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:27.830
I'm going to kill you!

577
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.310
Why did you have to do that?

578
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.770
Senpai!

579
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.930
I have something to tell you.

580
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.490
I have to go back now.

581
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.910
I see.

582
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.170
He left without saying anything.

583
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.350
That's it.

584
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.530
Take care.

585
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.130
Thank you for the meal.

586
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:47.370
Thank you for the meal.

587
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.810
It was a lot of fun.

588
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.990
That's good.

589
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:52.650
Excuse me.

590
00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:54.850
Kankichi.

591
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.630
Are you going home?

592
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.890
Mom is worried about you.

593
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.330
No, not today.

594
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.630
And the main ship is on duty now.

595
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.870
I'm going back to work now.

596
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.470
See you later, Ryo.

597
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.710
See you.

598
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.110
It seems that Yakko is not as

599
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.770
good as his mother.

600
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.510
He's still a young man.

601
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.110
I'm not going to pity him.

602
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.430
That's not true.

603
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.450
He's a great officer now.

604
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.290
He's still a young man to me.

605
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.390
San-chan, give me another one.

606
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:36.790
Yes, sir.

607
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.630
That idiot.

608
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:45.640
He's a fun person.

609
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.660
Yes.

610
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.640
He's just like Ryo.

611
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.900
See you later, San-chan.

612
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.460
Just once a year.

613
00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.080
See you later.

614
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.200
He broke the rules.

615
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.620
He broke the traffic rules.

616
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.880
He broke the rules.

617
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.300
Is this what a police officer should do?

618
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.280
Ryo Kankichi and Hayato

619
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.640
Honda are banned from their homes.

620
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.000
Sir, this is not us.

621
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.180
It's not true.

622
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.920
Next time, I'm not afraid of being

623
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.020
banned.

624
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.960
See you later.

625
00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:03.200
Even if it rains Tomorrow will be sunny

626
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.580
Bye-bye Let's wave our hands

627
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:17.840
Let's say goodbye Oh yeah Let's

628
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.800
live The way we like There are good

629
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:29.920
things Outside the door The sun is calling
