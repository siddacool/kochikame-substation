(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) The wind of the changing

2
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:25.550
seasons blows In the shining, best sunny day

3
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:34.030
Lightly crossing the rough times To the

4
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.130
city of hope, diving I wanna dive into

5
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.890
paradise I'll take all the trends

6
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.550
I'll be stronger and more honest Ready,

7
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.850
set, go!

8
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.710
Everybody can do!

9
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.970
The dream I started running always doesn't

10
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:05.310
stop I won't regret it tomorrow Everybody

11
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.290
can do!

12
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.790
Even if it's a little dark, I

13
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.570
don't want to see it I'll

14
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.250
take all the trends I'll be

15
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:30.360
stronger and more honest 4.

16
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:41.380
Mecha-Pote Declaration It

17
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.540
's cold again today.

18
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.900
Nothing will happen at night like this.

19
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
Let's stop patrolling and go home.

20
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.260
Sir!

21
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.540
Isn't this Katsushika's

22
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.040
dormitory?

23
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.640
How dare you!

24
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.100
Nakagawa, you go straight ahead!

25
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.660
Yes, sir!

26
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.920
Sir!

27
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.160
Where are you?

28
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.020
Where are you?

29
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.260
Where is the officer?

30
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.880
You!

31
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.780
You, too!

32
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.180
You, too!

33
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.680
Ouch!

34
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.300
Ouch!

35
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.680
I'm a police officer!

36
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.200
Hey!

37
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.240
I'm Ryotsu Kankichi,

38
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.620
the head of the police station!

39
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.880
Oh, you're right!

40
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.060
I'm Ryotsu Kankichi!

41
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.820
You!

42
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.080
I'm the real culprit of the underwear

43
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.180
thief!

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.060
Don't mess with me!

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.460
I'm not a underwear thief!

46
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.260
Then what's in your hand?

47
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.740
Huh?

48
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.340
That's the proof that you can't

49
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.440
move!

50
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.000
N-No!

51
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.580
I just grabbed it when I fell!

52
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.020
I heard a scream, so I came in

53
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.120
here!

54
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.700
Do you think that kind of excuse will

55
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.100
work?

56
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.820
It's true!

57
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.560
There's another one here!

58
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.540
No, it's not!

59
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.840
Mr. Nakagawa!

60
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.500
No way!

61
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.460
It's a misunderstanding.

62
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.180
We came here because we heard you were

63
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.280
a chikan.

64
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.800
It's no use.

65
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.320
I said it.

66
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.800
Oh, is that so?

67
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.080
No, we misunderstood.

68
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.200
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.440
Come to think of it, we were doing

70
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.820
special training for the chikan troupe.

71
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.960
Did you shout, chikan?

72
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.420
Hey, you guys!

73
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.320
You're saying the same thing, but you

74
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.960
don't believe what I'm saying, and

75
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.280
you don't even doubt what Nakag

76
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.680
awa says!

77
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.960
Oh, that's obvious.

78
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.460
Of course.

79
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.460
What kind of people do you think you

80
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.560
are?

81
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.700
Of course, it's the face.

82
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.640
You can't trust a man with a

83
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.180
thick face and eyebrows.

84
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.860
That's right.

85
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.860
And he's short.

86
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.060
He's short.

87
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.600
He's hot.

88
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.320
He's short, but he's got a

89
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.740
long story.

90
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.480
And he stinks.

91
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.420
You guys!

92
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.120
Stop what you're saying!

93
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.180
Stop it!

94
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.420
That sound...

95
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.180
Don't tell me...

96
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.420
Stop it, you idiot!

97
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.940
Stop it!

98
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.580
Ryo...

99
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.920
No, we misunderstood.

100
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.240
Nakagawa, you tried to steal his

101
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.019
underwear, didn't you?

102
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.959
No, I didn't!

103
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.160
I'm innocent!

104
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.920
That was a disaster, Ryo.

105
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.420
But that's because you didn't do

106
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.760
the right thing.

107
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.580
You should reflect on that.

108
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.540
I'm not joking.

109
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.560
What do you women think of men these

110
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.660
days?

111
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.200
I don't know what you're talking

112
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.400
about.

113
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.140
I do think that women these days are

114
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.820
beyond my understanding.

115
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.260
Even before...

116
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.520
Get your belly back!

117
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.140
Ryo...

118
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.200
You look pitiful.

119
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.500
Why don't you go out with me?

120
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.820
No, I don't want to.

121
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.220
You don't even have money.

122
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.260
Hey, you!

123
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.080
What are you looking at?

124
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.940
No, I'm not looking at anything.

125
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.840
Get out.

126
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.540
I can't believe him.

127
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.020
He's clearly an alien.

128
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.420
I've made up my mind!

129
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.600
What are you doing, Senpai?

130
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.360
I'm a married man.

131
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.440
I won't go out with women.

132
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.060
I won't go out with women within

133
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.320
2 meters of me.

134
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.200
No way.

135
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.640
Then you won't get a job.

136
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.480
Excuse me.

137
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.100
Which way is the station?

138
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.080
No, no.

139
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.020
Don't come in from that line.

140
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.020
What did you say?

141
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.920
You're a police officer, aren't you?

142
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.700
Oh, the station.

143
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.280
The station is...

144
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.760
You...

145
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.300
You...

146
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.420
You...

147
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.680
You idiot!

148
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.940
I won't go out with women, no

149
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.040
matter what anyone says!

150
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.180
That was close.

151
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.460
We could have arrested Ryo in a

152
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.560
minute.

153
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.600
You're right.

154
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.080
Huh?

155
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.580
He's in front of Ryo.

156
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.960
Why isn't there a maruta

157
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.840
in Ryo's garden?

158
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.620
Naoko, you're in trouble!

159
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.400
What's with this maruta?

160
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.980
You're Naoko Seisho, right?

161
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.020
Congratulations on winning.

162
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.180
Y-Yes.

163
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.480
I see.

164
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.720
Look, that's the prize.

165
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.660
Oh, that's the prize for the magazine.

166
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.300
I applied with a light heart, but I

167
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.140
didn't think I'd really win.

168
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.380
But Ryo's garden is spacious, so

169
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.960
it's fine, right?

170
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.540
You're right.

171
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.800
Look at Ryo's villa!

172
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.740
It's wonderful!

173
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.400
Now that we've completed the investigation, this

174
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.340
is the training video for building a log

175
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.440
house.

176
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.380
Good luck building it!

177
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.540
Huh?

178
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.000
We're going to build it?

179
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.560
What should we do?

180
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.780
We can't build something like this.

181
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.980
Does anyone know anyone who's good at

182
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.080
this?

183
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.000
There he is!

184
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.660
But he's definitely not going to do

185
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.760
it.

186
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.700
That's it!

187
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.780
I have a good idea!

188
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.000
Wait, wait!

189
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.120
Tomorrow, we'll gather everyone...

190
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.460
Wait, wait!

191
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.920
This is bad, Ryo-san!

192
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.440
Look at this.

193
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.840
This month's first issue of the survey.

194
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.280
I don't care about that!

195
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.460
Every month, he does a boring project.

196
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.240
That's clearly sexual harassment.

197
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.520
He's making fun of men.

198
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.220
What?

199
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.440
What's this?

200
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.920
Ryo's hated number one again?

201
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.380
That means we've finally reached V7.

202
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.160
Huh?

203
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.020
What's wrong?

204
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.000
Th-This is...

205
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.620
The hated number one Katsush

206
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.580
ika-shofukei told me

207
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.920
about...

208
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.960
It doesn't have my senpai's

209
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.820
name on it!

210
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.360
What?

211
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:11.720
Wh-What?

212
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.900
On top of that, Ryo-san

213
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.920
's the number one in high sensitivity.

214
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.420
Huh?

215
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:17.560
Ah!

216
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.260
This is...

217
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.380
The number one in high sensitivity, Ryo

218
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:21.920
-tsu Kankichi.

219
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.340
The number one in love, Ryo-

220
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:24.820
tsu Kankichi.

221
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.180
The number one in marriage, Ryo-

222
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.660
tsu Kankichi.

223
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.960
He's always holding down the top half

224
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.180
of his head.

225
00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:33.120
Isn't this some kind of misprint?

226
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.059
I don't think so.

227
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.780
Whether it's 5 o'clock or 6

228
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.720
o'clock...

229
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.260
Which means...

230
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.059
You!

231
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.039
You're playing dirty behind my back again!

232
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.980
Why would I do that?

233
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.240
Chief!

234
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.520
Chief!

235
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.380
I don't think you'd do something

236
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.040
that wouldn't make you rich.

237
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:49.900
Hm?

238
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.280
Now that you mention it, you're right.

239
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.140
But to suddenly get first place after the

240
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.580
reunion...

241
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.600
That's strange.

242
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.900
It's not strange!

243
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.660
The modern women have finally realized...

244
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.860
The true manliness!

245
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.700
Instead of pretending to be good, they've

246
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.060
started choosing the truth!

247
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.700
Ryo-tsu-senpai!

248
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.000
The number one in high sensitivity!

249
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.760
Congratulations!

250
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:15.980
Congratulations!

251
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.340
Ryo-tsu-senpai!

252
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.620
We've been misunderstanding Ryo-ts

253
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:20.940
u-senpai.

254
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.260
That's right.

255
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.560
We've finally realized how charming Ryo

256
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:24.660
-tsu-senpai is.

257
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.100
He's popular.

258
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.520
I can't believe it.

259
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.760
I'm going to lose.

260
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.480
Aren't women supposed to be on the

261
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:34.580
other side of the line?

262
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.560
You're so rude.

263
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.720
Don't cross that line!

264
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.220
Don't cross that line!

265
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.340
Huh?

266
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.640
I've decided not to deal with women!

267
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.840
Don't say that.

268
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.560
Shut up!

269
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.240
Get out!

270
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.740
Senpai!

271
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.880
Get out of here!

272
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.680
What's with that attitude?

273
00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.700
Calm down.

274
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.560
For now, the first stage is complete.

275
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.900
There's no way that idiot won't

276
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.900
come after us.

277
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.030
Ryo-tsu-senpai!

278
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.010
What do you think?

279
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.790
I think it's pretty good.

280
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.530
He's here.

281
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.290
Hello, I'm Rai-Rai

282
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:25.510
-Gen.

283
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.170
Is he going to perform with that?

284
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.370
I'm Rai-Rai-

285
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.530
Gen.

286
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.650
I brought some ramen.

287
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.150
Here you go.

288
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.830
I guess Ryo-tsu-

289
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.430
senpai's charm is his manliness.

290
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:42.890
That's right.

291
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.950
I can feel his manliness that other

292
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:46.050
men don't have.

293
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.190
That connected eyebrow is so

294
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.450
cute.

295
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.010
Really.

296
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.170
Good men are more honest than they look.

297
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.890
But it's sad.

298
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.590
He won't accept our passionate feelings.

299
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.310
You know, we...

300
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.250
Ryo-sama!

301
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.890
But he's not popular.

302
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.830
You always go against the man you like.

303
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.930
Well, it's true that women's hearts

304
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.930
are complicated.

305
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.270
Hey, you two.

306
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.070
Oh, Ryo-tsu-sen

307
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.190
pai.

308
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.850
Senpai, you didn't accept our bou

309
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.950
quet.

310
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.810
I couldn't accept it.

311
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.490
Naoko, I was so sad.

312
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.710
No, I'm sorry.

313
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.050
Oh, canned coffee?

314
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.850
It's good on a cold day like

315
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:39.950
this.

316
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.290
Give me a sip.

317
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.250
What?

318
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.010
You buy it yourself?

319
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.050
Naoko.

320
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.650
Oh, here you go.

321
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.770
Thank you.

322
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.010
It's good.

323
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.630
Here, you drink it, too.

324
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.490
What?

325
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.530
Don't hesitate to drink it.

326
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.010
But...

327
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.750
I'm so happy, Ryo-ts

328
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.190
u-senpai.

329
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.690
Why am I like this?

330
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.050
Good job, Naoko.

331
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.730
Well done.

332
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.090
I won't waste your precious sacrifice.

333
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.430
I'll finish it later.

334
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.730
Hey, Ryo-tsu-sen

335
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:53.830
pai.

336
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.710
Are you free tonight?

337
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.750
How about going for a drink after a

338
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.850
long time?

339
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.970
What?

340
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.970
Oh!

341
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.430
I thought it was someone, but it's

342
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.070
Honda-kun.

343
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.270
He's doing fine.

344
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.790
What are you wearing?

345
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.450
I have an appointment tonight.

346
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.030
I'm sorry, but I don't have

347
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.810
time to hang out with you.

348
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.650
Appointment?

349
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:23.970
Ryo-tsu-senpai

350
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.370
is invited to a girl's dormit

351
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.710
ory tonight.

352
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.990
To a girl's dormitory?

353
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.350
You're jealous, aren't you?

354
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.810
I can't take you.

355
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.370
I'm not going.

356
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.210
I'm the only one invited.

357
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.150
Women these days know what it's like

358
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.250
to be a man.

359
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.950
It's completely different from what I usually

360
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.590
say.

361
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.810
Girls' dormitory!

362
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.370
Good...

363
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.310
Evening!

364
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.290
Daddy!

365
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:03.510
Daddy!

366
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.010
I'm sure you know, but this is

367
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.250
actually a boy's dormitory.

368
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.050
Ryo-tsu-senpai

369
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.930
is special.

370
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.010
I'm impressed.

371
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.170
I can't believe it.

372
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.690
Ryo-tsu-senpai,

373
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.150
the moon is very beautiful.

374
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.330
Let's go see it.

375
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.190
It was cloudy when I got here.

376
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:33.250
I don't care!

377
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.170
Okay, now!

378
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.530
Got it!

379
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.410
This is a phantom, isn't it?

380
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.130
What's that?

381
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.230
What's that?

382
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.990
It's a log house kit.

383
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.750
We have all the log materials, so

384
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.870
we just need to put them together.

385
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.190
Gas and water pipes are one-t

386
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:04.290
ouch.

387
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.990
If we build it in Ryo's

388
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.370
garden, it'll be a place for everyone

389
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:06.870
to live.

390
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.210
But there's no log builder.

391
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.570
We can't build that.

392
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.910
Isn't there a strong man somewhere?

393
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.130
No, no.

394
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.090
All the men these days are weak.

395
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.670
It's nice to have a man who

396
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.110
sweats on his forehead.

397
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.690
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.870
The latest trend is a man who smells

399
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.970
like sweat.

400
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.530
I don't know what the trend is,

401
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.770
but have you forgotten someone?

402
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.090
Oh, what is it?

403
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.390
It's about a strong, reliable man.

404
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.030
Who are you talking about?

405
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.350
Is that about Ryo-tsu

406
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.770
-senpai?

407
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.790
No, I can't ask Ryo-

408
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.630
tsu-senpai to do that.

409
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.630
Why not?

410
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.810
Because Ryo-tsu-sen

411
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.570
pai is wearing a suit.

412
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.810
This is my temporary form.

413
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.670
This is my true form.

414
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.810
And this is my army.

415
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.150
It's such a big deal.

416
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.670
It's such a big deal.

417
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.210
Shut up!

418
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:18.710
Don't talk nonsense!

419
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.650
First of all, it's a basic construction.

420
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.610
You know that, don't you?

421
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.190
Come on!

422
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.830
Come on, let's do it!

423
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.130
Honda, what's with all the fuss?

424
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.010
Men are simple.

425
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.410
Come on, hurry up!

426
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:48.770
Don't worry about it.

427
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.150
Everyone, lunch is ready!

428
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.350
It's our homemade lunch box.

429
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.850
The cookies are homemade, too.

430
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.710
Wow, that's great.

431
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:01.790
It looks delicious.

432
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.609
Terai-san and Honda-san,

433
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.310
thank you.

434
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.310
Please do your best.

435
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.030
I'm counting on you.

436
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.609
Honda-san is much stronger than he

437
00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:09.709
looks.

438
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:11.670
Is that so?

439
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.450
Wow, Terai-san looks strong, too.

440
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.390
No, they're all weak.

441
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.349
You guys, go home!

442
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:21.430
Oh, no.

443
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.190
Oh, but you came all the way here.

444
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.990
Why don't you all work together?

445
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.790
I'm fine on my own.

446
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:29.830
Come on, let's go home.

447
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.170
You're so mean!

448
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.930
I made a mistake in my plan.

449
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.130
I guess I couldn't do it on

450
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.230
my own.

451
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.530
I can't ask them to help me

452
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:52.630
now.

453
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:54.570
They're so slow.

454
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.090
In this case, we have to praise them

455
00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.190
thoroughly.

456
00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.710
We have to make them work.

457
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.170
Okay!

458
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.970
Ryo-kun, hang in there!

459
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.850
You can do it!

460
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.310
You look great when you're working!

461
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.150
You're so cool!

462
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.070
Oh, really?

463
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.550
Oh, you surprised me!

464
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.110
You're so strong!

465
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.410
You're so cool!

466
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.070
You're so strong!

467
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:19.470
You're so cool!

468
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.510
You're so manly!

469
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.120
You're so cool!

470
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.150
Oh, you're so strong!

471
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.610
You're so easy to handle.

472
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.710
Let's keep doing this for the next

473
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.250
24 hours.

474
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.490
You can do it!

475
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:33.190
You can do it!

476
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:57.360
It looks

477
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:57.500
like we can't do it with just

478
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:57.960
1000 yen.

479
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.820
We need to get rid of one of

480
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:02.920
them.

481
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.820
Ryo-kun, are you okay?

482
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120
I'm a little tired.

483
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.540
I'll give you a massage.

484
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.580
Hang in there.

485
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.040
Hurry up and make our log house.

486
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:16.940
Of course!

487
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.860
We're back!

488
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.920
Here's your lunch.

489
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.040
See you later.

490
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.340
Are you leaving already?

491
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.680
I have a mission.

492
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.600
Another convenience store lunch box.

493
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.480
It used to be a handmade lunch box

494
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:48.580
of love.

495
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.360
The grade of the lunch box is going

496
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:53.900
down because of the incompleteness of

497
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.000
the house.

498
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.240
This again.

499
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.420
The days of bread and butter continue.

500
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.060
Ryo-kun, no one comes to

501
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.740
the garden these days.

502
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.920
It looks like you're forced to work.

503
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.380
If I keep doing this, I'll break

504
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:10.480
my body.

505
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.980
I feel like my seniors are being manipulated

506
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.260
by them.

507
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Nakagawa-kun, I know you

508
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.280
're jealous that I took the first place,

509
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.960
but you shouldn't think like that.

510
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.460
I don't think I'm that jealous.

511
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.120
Ouch.

512
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.140
But I'm really tired.

513
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.820
Seniors!

514
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.660
Ryo-kun!

515
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:43.820
Seniors!

516
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.440
Ryo-kun!

517
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.080
Seniors!

518
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.580
It seems that Ryo-kun hasn

519
00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:49.680
't come yet.

520
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.380
He's late.

521
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.600
He's almost here, but he's useless.

522
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.080
When will he finish?

523
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.340
I'm tired of waiting.

524
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.960
I worked so hard to take the first

525
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.200
place in the survey.

526
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.300
Just a little more patience.

527
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.180
I'm sorry.

528
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.540
I didn't mean to.

529
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.080
What's wrong?

530
00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.180
Did you say something?

531
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.400
Nothing.

532
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.660
Don't worry about it.

533
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.140
Just a little more.

534
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.420
I'll do my best.

535
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.440
I'm glad you didn't hear me.

536
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.960
I'm glad you're a real idiot.

537
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.280
Shh!

538
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.200
I can hear you.

539
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.430
I'll show you.

540
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.580
Wow!

541
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.080
Our villa!

542
00:21:50.640 --> 00:22:03.040
Let's

543
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.140
get in!

544
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.460
Agreed!

545
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.700
I'll show you what happens when you

546
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.660
make me angry.

547
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.120
I'll show you what happens when you

548
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.220
make me angry.

549
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.420
The scent of this tree!

550
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.680
I feel like I'm in a hot

551
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.000
spring in the mountains.

552
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.500
But I didn't expect him to build

553
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.740
such a nice log house.

554
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.120
Yeah.

555
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.060
He really worked hard.

556
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.560
I'm a little relieved.

557
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.660
Komachi-chan.

558
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.740
What?

559
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.860
You fell in love with Ryo Ts

560
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.180
ukankichi, didn't you?

561
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.020
Are you kidding me?

562
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.620
I'm scared.

563
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.200
No, you're not.

564
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.580
Everyone, be quiet.

565
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.060
The special seat is 5,000 yen.

566
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.520
The camera and video are 1,000 yen.

567
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.800
Let's go.

568
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.280
It's heaven!

569
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.380
You stupid women!

570
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:25.830
What?

571
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:26.270
Did you see that?

572
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.190
This is a real man's job.

573
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.030
What are you doing?

574
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.070
You're mean!

575
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.550
The mini-pad is messed up.

576
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.510
There's no tire.

577
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.350
I won't forgive you!

578
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.390
The revenge will continue!

579
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.370
I won't forgive you for bullying a

580
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:45.890
weak woman!

581
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.850
You're not weak at all!

582
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:51.370
Stop it!

583
00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.230
If I'm hated again, I'll go

584
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.350
back to No.

585
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.830
1.

586
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.240
A new year party at the chief's

587
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:07.340
house?

588
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.540
I haven't heard of it.

589
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.660
Why didn't you tell me?

590
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.360
Why didn't you tell me?

591
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.600
Chief!

592
00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.720
I'll go right now!

593
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.500
Please leave some food for me!

594
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.160
Next time, on Shinshun Battle

595
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.620
Karta.

596
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.640
Please watch it!
