2
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.270
Shining in the wind of season

3
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.250
On a perfect sunny day

4
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.270
Overcoming difficult times with ease

5
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.010
I'm heading to the city with a sense of hope

6
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.750
I wanna dive into paradise

7
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.510
Things happen so quickly

8
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.250
Wear it and have a strong style

9
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.590
It is better to sell it immediately

10
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.310
Let it rain!

11
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.690
Everyone can do it!

12
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.830
The dream that started running is always

13
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.850
It won't stop tomorrow either

14
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.070
Everyone can regret it

15
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.250
do!

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.370
Even if it sticks out a little

17
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.270
I don't want to see it. I don't like to make noise.

18
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.350
Embrace curiosity and go strong and high

19
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:30.380
Flew big

20
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:40.260
Treasures of the Hara family

21
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.510
Hey, is this road really okay?

22
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.090
Is it?

23
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.050
Yes, probably a recently built road.

24
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.790
I think so.

25
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.190
It's not even on the car navigation system.

26
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.830
So then.

27
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.450
I haven't seen a single one yet.

28
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.550
I haven't met anyone in my direction yet.

29
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.390
How about that, Honda?

30
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.750
Stay on the fast track

31
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.010
You can be sure of that.

32
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.610
It's a straight road all the way.

33
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.590
But, Director, are you really serious about this?

34
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.210
Are you commuting from somewhere?

35
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.070
Yes, from JR to the facilities, and

36
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.729
Bus and then 20 minutes walk

37
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.949
minutes.

38
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.770
It took about two and a half hours in total.

39
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.210
It seems that...

40
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.010
Yes, it's a five hour round trip.

41
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.790
I feel like I'm going to faint.

42
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.750
By the way, Ryo-chan,

43
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.730
Birthday present for the chief

44
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.930
nt, what did you buy?

45
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.090
This is it.

46
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.930
Let's keep it a secret until we get there.

47
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.950
What?

48
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.290
Everybody puts money in

49
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.890
He told me because it was a good fit.

50
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.630
That's fine.

51
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.230
Don't worry.

52
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.050
My specially selected item

53
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.450
It is a thing.

54
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.690
no doubt.

55
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.110
That's not it.

56
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.650
What are the people who are

57
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.630
I don't know what to give

58
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.370
I'm saying that's strange.

59
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.750
That's it.

60
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.810
That's right.

61
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.410
The most amazing thing

62
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.730
That's all I'll say.

63
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.570
Manager, if you see this

64
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.150
I was so moved that I fainted.

65
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.070
There is no doubt.

66
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.110
Oh, before I knew it,

67
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.230
I'm in the housing area.

68
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.770
It should be soon

69
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.310
That's right.

70
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.910
But this is somehow sad.

71
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.150
It's a sight.

72
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.210
So what are you doing all of a sudden?

73
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.950
Is that so, senpai?

74
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.090
Oh, s-senpai.

75
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.150
Well, let me just ask you something.

76
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.290
yes.

77
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.810
Do you know the Ohara house?

78
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.910
Don't you think so?

79
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.070
Oh, then, one more

80
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.130
It's about two years away.

81
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.550
is that so.

82
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.730
Um, if you don't mind, I'll go to the car.

83
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.990
Please get on and show me around.

84
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.750
I'll send it to you properly.

85
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.530
But it's a one-way street, so I get lost.

86
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.650
That's not the case.

87
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.530
Well well, don't say that.

88
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.710
They say that travelling is a journey

89
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.470
Isn't that right?

90
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.490
Ah, when I see a beautiful woman

91
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.530
This is what happens right away.

92
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.450
Orilo Honda, this person

93
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.950
Because I'll ride.

94
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.590
Well, then what should I do?

95
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.110
Is that okay?

96
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.530
Hey, it's just a short walk away

97
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.010
That's right.

98
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.090
If so, please guide me.

99
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.810
Even if you don't.

100
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.710
Um, I can't do it.

101
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.910
You don't have to give me a ride.

102
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.610
Sorry, please wait a moment.

103
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.430
Oh, get off now

104
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.810
That's what he says.

105
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.750
Senior, this car seats five people.

106
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.270
You can.

107
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.610
Shut up, Makagawa.

108
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.790
I don't like narrow spaces.

109
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.050
What?

110
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.829
Ryo-chan, Honda-san

111
00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:16.550
Isn't that sad?

112
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.370
Reiko, sit up front.

113
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.470
Honda, Waiting for the Lady

114
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.870
I don't think it's bad to

115
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.230
Is that so?

116
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.790
N-No way.

117
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.490
Shinou, don't fall

118
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.450
Get off now.

119
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.750
Hurry up, please.

120
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.250
Maybe, why is this happening?

121
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.570
Yes.

122
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.090
Why is it happening now?

123
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.350
Yo.

124
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.970
Well, then, your boss,

125
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.150
To celebrate a birthday.

126
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.030
That's right, this is also a part of the world.

127
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.210
It's a matter of obligation.

128
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.590
That's difficult.

129
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.890
A precious day off

130
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.590
Why did you go to such a mountain?

131
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.990
All the way inside.

132
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.770
Oh my goodness.

133
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.850
Places where raccoons are likely to appear

134
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.330
I built a house in

135
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.690
and.

136
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.870
See, excuse me.

137
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.310
The young lady also lives around here.

138
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.770
Are you okay?

139
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.170
Um, yeah, well, anyway.

140
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.290
Happy birthday!

141
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.150
I can't believe they did that for me.

142
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.810
That person is a very subordinate.

143
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.010
He is really loved by everyone.

144
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.430
no way.

145
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.170
Hardworking, honest, and flexible

146
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.630
Not listening and being bossy is anger.

147
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.070
The sound is, the feet stink,

148
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.490
To be so loved,

149
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.570
Not once in a while.

150
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.630
I wouldn't work under someone like that.

151
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.970
I don't think you have to

152
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.670
It's poison.

153
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.450
Well, sometimes I'm in a good mood

154
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.510
I have to get it.

155
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.350
In the case of seniors, there are various

156
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.630
You're causing me trouble.

157
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.830
hey.

158
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.910
Yeah, this is annoying

159
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.670
I'm being kicked.

160
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.390
Ah, it's over there.

161
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.390
I see, this is the manager’s

162
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.930
Home?

163
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.630
Small balcony, impossible

164
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.530
Garden lights in the garden

165
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.850
to.

166
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.550
But you know what, this little guy?

167
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.570
To build a small house

168
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.310
Reflection on the sweat and tears

169
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.590
So you sent it?

170
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.530
Yes, you'll come to my house.

171
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.390
I have to send it.

172
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.550
It's ok, I'm here too.

173
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.750
from.

174
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.010
Because this is my place.

175
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.510
It's home.

176
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.490
So that means,

177
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.990
Just leave it.

178
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.090
Yes, arrogant and yelling

179
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.630
It's tough and

180
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.630
Unstoppable

181
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.830
This is Tsukasa's daughter, Hiromi.

182
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.010
Welcome everyone.

183
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.570
Are you the manager?

184
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.290
yes.

185
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.210
Well, I noticed that a while ago.

186
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.730
Were you there?

187
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.490
Yes, Ryoji and others

188
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.850
My father told me a lot about

189
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.870
Because I had heard that.

190
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.390
No, I, the manager

191
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.750
This is something that I have been thinking about a lot lately.

192
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.930
I respect him very much.

193
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.650
The chief is really a police officer.

194
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.670
Yes, it is a mirror of.

195
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.590
It's okay, don't overdo it.

196
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.770
That's it.

197
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.250
Because my father is really

198
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.290
That's the street it is.

199
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.230
Yes, that's right.

200
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.930
Honda has arrived too.

201
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.330
Oh, customer.

202
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.770
Someone suddenly.

203
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.730
Yeah, no, thank you very much.

204
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.310
What are you guys here for?

205
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.570
That's it.

206
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.370
I don't know what you're here for.

207
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.550
Sho.

208
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.690
Cute subordinate is the boss

209
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.130
I came all the way here, yearning for you.

210
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.150
I think it has arrived.

211
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.010
Too cute to hate

212
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.950
It's a thousand times more.

213
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.250
Oh, welcome.

214
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.850
Nasan.

215
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.270
Sorry, all of a sudden,

216
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.130
I ended up forcing my way in.

217
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.190
Thank you.

218
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.030
Get up.

219
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.770
Excuse me for interrupting.

220
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.970
Excuse me for interrupting.

221
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.390
Come on, please.

222
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.010
No, boss, it's a fine house.

223
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.390
That's right.

224
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.430
The construction of this entrance is...

225
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.530
A small but well-organized

226
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.010
Please wait,

227
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.490
A good personality,

228
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.730
It is really apparent, isn't it?

229
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.450
Yeah.

230
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.750
And the common people in this wallpaper

231
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.410
A taste of greatness,

232
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.790
Give this tension to

233
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.330
This ingenuity is the reason why

234
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.190
You are standing up.

235
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.630
That's fine.

236
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.850
What are you talking about, Dad?

237
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.890
Thank you for coming.

238
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.330
But I did.

239
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.750
Hey, Ryoji-san!

240
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.050
But.

241
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.630
The manager has such a cute daughter

242
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.810
I never knew there was someone like that.

243
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.710
The black kite gave birth to the swan

244
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.670
Should I say that?

245
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.010
Hey, Ryoji.

246
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.350
I would like to say this again.

247
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.490
But I have a bad feeling.

248
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.150
Don't do that.

249
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.170
Well, Hiromi is you.

250
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.330
A rough man like

251
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.670
To have an action

252
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.350
I don't think so.

253
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.850
Anyway, I

254
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.990
He's a simple man.

255
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.830
I'm a bit surprised by the manager though.

256
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.190
Wh, what?!

257
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.710
Dad, stop it.

258
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.390
Because this is not a workplace.

259
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.090
Oh, oh, sorry.

260
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.230
But again.

261
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.409
What's wrong? Did you suddenly push me?

262
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.210
I can't believe it.

263
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.370
Oh, I really agree.

264
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:36.990
Isn't it?

265
00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.310
Dad, happy birthday

266
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.750
Congratulations.

267
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.130
birthday!?

268
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.510
Congratulations, Manager.

269
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.250
congratulations.

270
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.710
congratulations.

271
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.590
Congratulations, Manager.

272
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.570
Yes, Dad.

273
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.110
Wh-Wh-Boss, don't you have anything to say?

274
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.550
Is that so?

275
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.930
Oh, thank you everyone.

276
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.850
congratulations.

277
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.980
Well then, you guys.

278
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.580
Celebrate my birthday

279
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.820
All the way to do so.

280
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.540
Oh, boss, she's crying.

281
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:18.780
mosquito?

282
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.820
You idiot, why are you crying?

283
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.020
Ran.

284
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.460
Yes, Dad.

285
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.940
This is me and my mom

286
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.140
から。

287
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.840
おう、革靴か。

288
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.360
うん、大切に使わせて

289
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:33.900
もらうぞ。

290
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.280
部長、 これ、あたしたちから

291
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.620
のささやかなプレゼ

292
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.740
ントってやつで。

293
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.920
なんだ?

294
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.280
ずいぶん大きいが。

295
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.120
結局、先輩、何買ったんです

296
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.520
かね?

297
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.280
さあ。

298
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.140
な、なんだこれは?

299
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.820
どうです、部長?

300
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.080
懐かしいでしょ?

301
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.740
デパートでちょうど懐

302
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.700
かしの駄菓子フェ

303
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.600
アをやってましてね。

304
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.860
おら、銀玉やメンコ、

305
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.980
銀玉鉄砲にパチン

306
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.440
コ、スコンブリ、ソース

307
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.680
せんべい、 イカのス

308
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.060
ズケなんてのもありますよ。

309
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.420
それからこのバクチク。

310
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.940
昔はニービーナンズって

311
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.860
もっとでっかいやつだ

312
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.320
ったんだけど。

313
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.680
先輩、ひょっとして集め

314
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.200
たお金を全部それに?

315
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.480
当然だろ。

316
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.480
いや、二万円もあるとず

317
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.460
いぶんたくさん買える

318
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.040
もんだな。

319
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.760
お前たち知らなかった

320
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.060
のか?

321
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.060
ええ、先輩がプレゼ

322
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.160
ントを自分で選ぶって

323
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.020
聞かなかったもので。

324
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.860
やっぱりリョウちゃんに

325
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.020
任せたのが間違い

326
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.820
だったわね。

327
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.120
ねえねえ、これ何なの?

328
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.980
何だよ、メンコも知

329
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.460

330
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.260
よーし、見てろよ。

331
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.020
こいつはこうやって、 と、裏返

332
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.120
ったらもらえるんだ。

333
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.100
うわあ、おもしろいわ

334
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.340
ね。

335
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.360
メンコっていうものは、こうやって

336
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.000
腰を入れて、 と、やるも

337
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.140
んだ。

338
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.120
部長なんかに負けるもんです

339
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.380
か。

340
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.380
やりおったな。

341
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.640
どうだ、参ったか。

342
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.400
諸君、今日は本当にありがとう。

いと思うんだが。

お、お茶?

356
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.500
何だこの部屋は。

357
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.940
多分何にもないんじゃない

358
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.200
か。

359
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.240
ここは茶室です。

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.080
この部屋を作ったのか?

367
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.120
リョウちゃん、ここは正座

368
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.240

369
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.660
え、そうなの?

370
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.540

Bump.

Well then, please wait a while.

382
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.380
Please.

383
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.140
Hey Ryo-chan, do you understand?

384
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.960
When having tea

385
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.840
Like this, slowly pour the bowl

386
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.220
Chestnut.

387
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.040
Oh, what?

388
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.260
I know that much.

389
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.440
Round and round, five,

390
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.500
It spins about three times.

391
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.620
That's stupid.

392
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.200
If you turn it vertically, the tea will

393
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.060
It'll spill.

394
00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.060
Yeah.

395
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:11.670
I guess he's being stingy

396
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.930
this.

397
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.770
Shhh, it's already started.

398
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.130
Honro, what's wrong?

399
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.890
No, my legs are numb.

400
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.770
Please have some sweets.

401
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.090
Yes, I've been waiting for this.

402
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.510
Ah, the bugs are finally gone!

403
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:47.710
It came out.

404
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.510
Thank you very much.

405
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.930
Hey, you barbarian.

406
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.510
Yeah.

407
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.510
You are the heart of tea

408
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.890
I totally understand that.

409
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.790
You don’t have to do anything

410
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.730
So I just sat there in silence.

411
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.910
Right.

412
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.310
Ok, I understand.

413
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.630
Barbarians aside,

414
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.870
My prized tea bowl

415
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.170
I hope you enjoy it.

416
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.450
Teacup?

417
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.950
This is the best for me right now

418
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.230
It's something I cherish.

419
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.430
Right.

420
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:21.730
oh dear.

421
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.130
When I traveled to Kyoto

422
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.850
I desperately want to find it

423
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.590
I think I'll use it for the rest of my life.

424
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.010
I decided to buy it.

425
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.690
I did.

426
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.230
It's a black Raku tea bowl.

427
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.030
It seems to be quite good.

428
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.510
I think it was made by Takagoe.

429
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.270
Oh, you understand?

430
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.230
The black luster is amazing

431
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.830
That's interesting.

432
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.570
Serve everyone with this bowl

433
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.330
I believe it.

434
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.970
It's shiny.

435
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.190
Such an ordinary

436
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.230
Isn't that a rice bowl?

437
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.790
R,Ryotsu!

438
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.590
Hey, hey, stop it!

439
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.890
That's fine.

440
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.070
Please show me.

441
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.670
Ryoutsu!

442
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.300
Wow, boss, that was close.

443
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:12.540
Shin.

444
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.260
This time, NiceCas

445
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.560
That's it.

446
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.800
Idiot!

447
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.280
Be careful.

448
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.080
This bowl costs 400,000 yen.

449
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.080
We are very close friends.

450
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.000
Huh, four hundred thousand?!

451
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.960
That filthy teacup!

452
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.420
In the world, you

453
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.940
Something of incomprehensible value

454
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.160
exists.

455
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.270
That was quite a feat.

456
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.970
Yeah.

457
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.730
Han, you saw too much

458
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.670
You're just flattering me.

459
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.140
Very, very good.

460
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.420
It was.

461
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.580
It was delicious.

462
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.400
Yeah, I don’t know the etiquette.

463
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.800
Anyway, enjoy it properly.

464
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.880
Just give it to me.

465
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.740
Now, I'll give everyone some tea.

466
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.720
Stand up and stand

467
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.800
I can't just do it.

468
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.380
I guess I won't go either.

469
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.240
Yes, chief, I

470
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.220
Ochazuke is better than tea

471
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.080
Something smooth.

472
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.900
Hmm, I'm sure you

473
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.200
Does that suit you better?

474
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.760
Maybe.

475
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.120
But the food is ready now

476
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.280
I'm still doing it, so I'll do my best.

477
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.700
Be patient.

478
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:21.580
father?

479
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.920
There's a phone call coming in.

480
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:24.960
I see.

481
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.880
Well then, Ryotsu, wait.

482
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.740
Please be careful with the rice bowl.

483
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.720
Don't touch it.

484
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.700
That's nice.

485
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.860
I know.

486
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.560
It's really okay.

487
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.720
Oh, dear.

488
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.300
What on earth is 400,000?

489
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.920
It's a rice bowl.

490
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.300
That's such a great guy

491
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.200
Well, put a price tag on it.

492
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:49.900
That's right.

493
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.300
But with 400,000 bowls

494
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.500
Drinking tea...

495
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.040
I got quite nervous.

496
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.720
The tea ceremony utensils are simple

497
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.240
They may look like that, but they are all worth it

498
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.280
There are only things that

499
00:16:59.280 --> 00:16:59.560
Yo.

500
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.720
Something like this.

501
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.640
Oh, this is an ear pick.

502
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.079
What do you mean?

503
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.440
Senior, that's not good.

504
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.200
Don't do that.

505
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.240
That's right.

506
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.420
Hey, that's amazing.

507
00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.000
Now it's my turn.

508
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.180
Tea for them

509
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:16.900
You'll die.

510
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.160
The true tea ceremony is like this.

511
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.560
Just keep writing

512
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.200
Like a spinning washing machine

513
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.540
is.

514
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.300
Oh, round and round.

515
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.100
Ah, round and round.

516
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.660
Hey, stop it.

517
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.880
Oh, round and round.

518
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.020
Oh, round and round.

519
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.600
Oh, it's spinning

520
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.540
round and round.

521
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.440
Oh, round and round.

522
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.160
Ryo-chan, stop it already

523
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:37.780
Bye.

524
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.520
Oh, round and round.

525
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.000
senior!

526
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.060
senior!

527
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.780
Hey, the first one

528
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.480
That was too much.

529
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.720
Ryo, Ryo-chan.

530
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.320
senior.

531
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.520
Wh-what?

532
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.560
And finally.

533
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.100
I messed up.

534
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.600
So, so easy!

535
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.660
It's so frustrating.

536
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.720
The boss was tricked

537
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.440
No doubt about it.

538
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.500
Well, sorry to keep you waiting.

539
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.960
Ryozu, what are you doing?

540
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.100
do.

541
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.300
No, but the chief

542
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.220
Tsuni Utsukushio-chan

543
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:22.720
That's right.

544
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.840
You're like that

545
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.780
Can you understand the difference?

546
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.220
Of course I understand that.

547
00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.960
This feeling is too much

548
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.020
It's so wonderful.

549
00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.480
I don't feel like talking.

550
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:33.740
Yo.

551
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:34.920
Is that true?

552
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.840
Well then, let's have some tea now.

553
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.880
I'll set it up for you, so hurry up.

554
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.800
Give it back.

555
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.840
N-no, no.

556
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.140
It's been like this for a while now

557
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.280
Please allow me to confirm.

558
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.840
No, no.

559
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.320
Let me hold it for you

560
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.380
Something good has happened

561
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:47.800
Money.

562
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.540
Come on, give it back quickly.

563
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.600
Well, just a little more.

564
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.260
No good.

565
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.880
Just a little more.

566
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.560
Hey, Ryozu, listen

567
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.060
Let's be happy.

568
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.620
Oh, what is that?

569
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.680
Hey, wait a minute.

570
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.640
Not again?

571
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.680
The tea party is over.

572
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:06.880
of?

573
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.420
Now, the barbecue

574
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.480
I'm slurping,

575
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:10.900
That's it.

576
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.260
A barbecue?

577
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.500
It'll burn soon.

578
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.080
Oh, yes, thank you.

579
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:21.800
Where are you, Ryozu?

580
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.700
Were you there?

581
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.220
Come on, hurry up with the bowl

582
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.720
Give it back.

583
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.740
Hey, Ryozu.

584
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:30.800
There you go, boss.

585
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.940
Seeing in nature

586
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.420
And it goes even further.

587
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.480
This tea bowl.

588
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.100
That's fine, hurry up.

589
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.640
Give it back.

590
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.280
What on earth happened?

591
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.520
Ah, no.

592
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.420
You,

593
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.140
To the customer

594
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:42.540
It's Rei.

595
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.540
R, Ryozu-san, meal

596
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.420
Please come up.

597
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.560
Sorry.

598
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.720
If you return it now, I will forgive you.

599
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.080
I'll do it.

600
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.580
Here, give it back gently.

601
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.460
That's true.

602
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.740
If you return it now, I will forgive you.

603
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.580
They will do that for you.

604
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.240
Ah, man, Nigong

605
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.520
There is none.

606
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.920
What should I do?

607
00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.920
Please, I'll bring it back.

608
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.280
Daku-chan is easy to break

609
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:00.520
All right.

610
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.860
Something happened with Maichi.

611
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.420
What should I do?

612
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.560
There is no way to recover

613
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.100
I think so.

614
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:04.960
you.

615
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.600
What is it, like a child?

616
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.520
Ryozu-san is a demon

617
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.180
You can't eat it.

618
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.960
That's okay, Dad.

619
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.700
That bowl, for a while

620
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.500
To Mr. Kuryouzu

621
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.220
Just do it.

622
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.440
I-Is that really the case, you idiot?

623
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.480
Oh, about my daughter.

624
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.540
Calling it a duck

625
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.320
That's terrible.

626
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.180
Oh, no, sorry.

627
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.320
Okay then.

628
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.080
Honda-san, you're burnt over there

629
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.280
Yo.

630
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.340
Well, let's eat.

631
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.100
Ryo-chan, why did you eat it?

632
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.560
Isn't there one?

633
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.220
It's so delicious.

634
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.080
That's right, hurry up.

635
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.400
Woof.

636
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.780
Reiko, let me eat

637
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.040
Here it is.

638
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.860
Sorry.

639
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.740
Hey, Ryoji.

640
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.660
Look, for now

641
00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:50.800
eye.

642
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.980
Well then, no fun.

643
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.040
That's a beer drinker.

644
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.420
isn't it.

645
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.220
See?

646
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.540
Oh, not at all.

647
00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.820
I can't tell my senior that.

648
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.160
thing.

649
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.060
It's okay, here you go.

650
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:04.860
here we go.

651
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.340
Your meat is burning

652
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:09.720
Right.

653
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.480
What was that just now?

654
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.200
Wh-what is it?

655
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.780
My Eyes

656
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.040
Or maybe?

657
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.700
Now there are two teacups.

658
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.460
It seemed that way.

659
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.960
Of course, I'm already drunk.

660
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.780
What happened?

661
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.900
That can't be true.

662
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.080
Sho.

663
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.360
Okay, show me the bowl.

664
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:27.500
reactor.

665
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.700
it is.

666
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.280
Ryoji.

667
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.560
In that bowl.

668
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.280
What on earth did you do?

669
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.620
Something like the sun

670
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.720
2, it's important

671
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.700
Being toyed with is

672
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.720
I can't take it anymore.

673
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.160
Come on, give it back to me.

674
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.200
Wait, Ryoji.

675
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.860
No, no.

676
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.600
Don't wait.

677
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.340
Hey, Ryoji.

678
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.280
My, my baby.

679
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.900
Ah, it's the chief's fault.

680
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.900
And it got torn apart.

681
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.800
My, my, my

682
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.160
The only reason

683
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.240
It was originally from.

684
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.680
What will I do from tomorrow?

685
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680
Live with joy

686
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.440
Go ahead.

687
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.880
Hey, Dad.

688
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.260
Don't be so upset

689
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:29.480
in.

690
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.160
Also, new

691
00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:31.920
Just buy it.

692
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:32.920
Hey.

693
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.820
Oh, delicious.

694
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.800
Ryo-chan.

695
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.940
What? Hurry up and

696
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.800
All by myself

697
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.780
I'm going to explode.

698
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.280
Ryo-chan, Chan and Aya

699
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:41.780
Get stuck.

700
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.160
The headmaster is cute.

701
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.520
Right.

702
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.360
Headmaster, something with a shape

703
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.560
It will break someday.

704
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.300
That is the mystery

705
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:51.740
This is Nri.

706
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.900
Instead, let's smile.

707
00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.080
Yo.

708
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:54.840
It's delicious.

709
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.500
I don't need it.

710
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.860
You eat it.

711
00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.800
Well then, let's have fun.

712
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.560
It's Ryo-chan now.

713
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.740
Actually, boss.

714
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.260
Oh, idiot, stop it.

715
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.320
That's how it is.

716
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:07.820
what?

717
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.540
No, boss, I was just too impulsive.

718
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:09.680
in.

719
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.260
I never had any bad intentions.

720
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.860
That's why.

721
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.040
Ryou.

722
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.060
Mr. Forgive.

723
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.880
Bu, boss.

724
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.700
Oh, boss, I

725
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.840
Even if we had a barbecue

726
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.200
It's not tasty.

727
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.860
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

728
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.760
You got what you deserve, Ryo

729
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.100
Chan is.

730
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.520
Don't worry, happy birthday

731
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.200
It has become like that, Hiromi.

732
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.060
But I had a lot of fun.

733
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.220
It seems like it, Dad.

734
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.840
Ryozu's Corner

735
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.220
Grilled.

736
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.340
This is the best for me

737
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.640
This is a present.

738
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.940
Boss, please forgive me.

739
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.780
Nakagawa, Reiko, and

740
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.580
Oh, Hiromi, help me!

741
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.120
Give it to me.

742
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.860
Height 167 cm Weight 71 kg

743
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.360
