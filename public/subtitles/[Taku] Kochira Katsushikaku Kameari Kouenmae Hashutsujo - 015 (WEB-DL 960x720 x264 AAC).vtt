00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:23.650

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.230
sun shines Lightly passing through the turb

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.890

13
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.030

For love!

17
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.200
Aren't you hungry?

18
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.880
How about stir-fried ribs and dumplings?

19
00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.620
Chinese food?

20
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.440
Sounds good!

21
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.300
What?

22
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.280
Watch out, Honda!

23
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.740
Don't be so angry, Ryotsu.

24
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.540
Anyway, I'm going to buy some lunch.

25
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.320
I'll buy it with you.

26
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.620
I'll take delivery today.

27
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.060
I'm not going to treat you.

28
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.160
Are you sure?

29
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.200
Why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.800
I'm going to have a special dish.

31
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.660
It's been a long time since I

32
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.060
had tonjiru.

33
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.720
You're such an old man.

34
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.040
How about you, Nakagawa?

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.460
Me?

36
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.500
Yes.

37
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.120
Hey, Nakagawa!

38
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.140
It's your treat.

39
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.760
Make it cheap.

40
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.520
I'll have a fried chicken bento.

41
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.060
Okay.

42
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.180
Here you go.

43
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.540
See you later, Nakagawa.

44
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.900
See you later.

45
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.240
It's rare to see someone with such

46
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.660
a different personality.

47
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.680
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.780
Hello.

49
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.100
Welcome.

50
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.800
Are you going to buy bento again?

51
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.680
Yes.

52
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.800
My bento is the best.

53
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.300
It's really delicious.

54
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.400
I'm glad to hear that.

55
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.720
What would you like to have today?

56
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.260
I'd like a special hirek

57
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.880

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.080

And two tonjiru, please.

61
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.680

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.660
What?

65
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.240
Did I make a mistake?

66
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.660
No, it's okay.

67
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.260

Here you go.

Thank you for waiting.

76
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.120
Thank you for coming all the way here.

77
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.600
I'm always grateful to you.

78
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.200
It's important to be grateful.

79
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.240
You're different from other people.

80
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.399
You're different from other people.

81
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.019
That's what the manager said.

82
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.320
He's talking about you.

83
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
Isn't the rice here a little dry?

84
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.880
You're right.

85
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.540
That's not true.

86
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.420
I'm using the best waist light.

87
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.540
The ass is a little salty, too.

88
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.000
This is just right.

89
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.480
This bento is the best.

90
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.080
There's so much love in it.

91
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.260
I read it.

92
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.760
What?

93
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.380
You made a lot of mistakes with the

94
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.480
number of bentos.

95
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.840
You got paid to advertise the bento

96
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.300
shop, didn't you?

97
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.980
That's not true.

98
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.500
I got it.

99
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.720
Mr. Honda.

100
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200
You like the girl at the bento

101
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.480
shop, don't you?

102
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.960
No, I don't.

103
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.780
I see.

104
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.740
That clerk is cute.

105
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.520
How do you know that?

106
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.680
You can tell who it is by looking

107
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.220
at his red face.

108
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.040
I'm in trouble.

109
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.820
What's her name?

110
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.860
Megumi Hoshino.

111
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.200
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.620
Give up on her.

113
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.120
Why?

114
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.400
Ryo, are you still friends with her?

115
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.760
Help her.

116
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.420
Reiko.

117
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.660
How many times do you think she's

118
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.460
been out of love?

119
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.000
It's not once or twice.

120
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.200
It's a hundred times.

121
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.680
It's exactly 101 times.

122
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.400
Really?

123
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.060
Every time she's out of love.

124
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.900
But...

125
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.400
Stop it, Reiko.

126
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.440
It's impossible to be in love forever.

127
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.380
I won't listen to you.

128
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.020
Chief.

129
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:02.420
What?

130
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.720
It's rude to me.

131
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.800
It's a nice middle for killing a

132
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.900
girl.

133
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.640
Don't make a joke.

134
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.340
Come on.

135
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.280
If this is the case, I'll go

136
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.860
to Honda with her.

137
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.080
Really?

138
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.680
Yes.

139
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.320
I'll leave it to you.

140
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.080
Are you sure?

141
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.440
Yes.

142
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.820
I'll go with you and Megumi.

143
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.580
I'm counting on you.

144
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.540
Yes.

145
00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.540
Chief.

146
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.340
How was it?

147
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.840
No.

148
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.440
I'm in love with a man.

149
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.100
What?

150
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.380
No way.

151
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.260
What kind of man is he?

152
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.480
He comes here every morning.

153
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.620
He says he's in love with a

154
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.240
white-collar worker.

155
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.800
I won't say anything bad.

156
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.880
Megumi will give up.

157
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.280
I'm in love with a white-

158
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.400
collar worker, too.

159
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.940
I go to the store every morning.

160
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.160
What did you say?

161
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.600
I go to the store every morning.

162
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.120
Come on, Honda.

163
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.320
Hey, Megumi.

164
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.560
Yes.

165
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.520
Isn't he the white-collar

166
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.060
worker you were talking about?

167
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.100
Look.

168
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.020
He always comes to the store.

169
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.360
Hello.

170
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.360
How is he?

171
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:00.900
Does he look like him?

172
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.140
No.

173
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.220
He doesn't look like him at all.

174
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.540
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.780
He has a slim figure, but he has

176
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.680
a tight face.

177
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.500
He always has his arms outstretched,

178
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.800
and his scarf is fluttering.

179
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.000
He's really manly and cool.

180
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.800
It's me.

181
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.240
Look closely.

182
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.160
Megumi.

183
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.220
His face is different.

184
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.299
You may not believe it, but when this

185
00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.400
Honda rides a bike, his face and personality

186
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.340
are completely different.

187
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.919
You call him Mr. Honda.

188
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.120
This Honda is the best white-coll

189
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.460
ar worker.

190
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.360
He's the best white-collar

191
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.600
worker in the world.

192
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.680
That's right.

193
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.860
Mr. Honda is a white-collar

194
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.200
worker, so you know who comes to the

195
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.720
store every morning, right?

196
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.380
No, that's not it.

197
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.820
Yes, I do.

198
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.100
Please leave it to me.

199
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.400
What?

200
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.880
Mr. Honda, if you know his name, please

201
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.300
tell me.

202
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.720
Yes.

203
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.300
She made an unnecessary promise.

204
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.140
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.320
I see.

206
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.320
It's getting complicated.

207
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.640
Megumi likes Mr. Honda when he rides

208
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.840
a bike, so she can't be Mr.

209
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.620
Honda now?

210
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.400
Honda, there's only one way.

211
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.800
What should I do?

212
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.500
From now on, you will continue to ride

213
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.480
a bike in front of Megumi.

214
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.000
What?

215
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.840
That's impossible.

216
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.320
I know it's impossible.

217
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.280
If you ask her out on a bike,

218
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.980
she will definitely say yes.

219
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.620
I'm sure of it.

220
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.640
That may be true, but...

221
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.540
That's a little too much.

222
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.520
Men and women are important in the beginning.

223
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.640
If you decide there, the rest will be

224
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:48.860
fine.

225
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.680
Is that so?

226
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.080
I'm sure it's because the nice

227
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.240
middle of killing women says so.

228
00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.520
I'll do it.

229
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.200
Mr. Honda.

230
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.980
I like her.

231
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.640
If I can date such a wonderful person,

232
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.460
I don't care what happens next.

233
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.540
All right.

234
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.340
It's decided.

235
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.740
All we have to do is attack.

236
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480
Yes, sir.

237
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.120
Good morning.

238
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.800
Mana.

239
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.960
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.180
Nice to meet you.

241
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.640
I'm Megumi Hoshino.

242
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.360
What's your name?

243
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.220
I'm Honda.

244
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.120
Are you Mr. Honda, too?

245
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.600
No, I'm Honda's friend, Suzuki.

246
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:44.960
What's your name?

247
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:45.960
I'm Suzuki.

248
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.500
I can't ride a bike with a

249
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:48.640
woman.

250
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.540
How about it?

251
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.920
Would you give your life to me and

252
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.480
feel the wind with me?

253
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.160
Yes, I'd love to.

254
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.760
Then I'll pick you up here at

255
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:02.860
9 a.

256
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:02.960
m.

257
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.060
on Sunday.

258
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.300
Yes, sir.

259
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.740
See you.

260
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:06.080
Take this!

261
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.630
Now I've got the prize money.

262
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.770
What's up, Mr. Honda?

263
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.050
I did it.

264
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.150
I'm going on a date on Sunday.

265
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.670
I see.

266
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.250
You did it.

267
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.570
Listen.

268
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.350
Don't get off the bike during the

269
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.450
date.

270
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.210
Yes, sir.

271
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:45.780
Mr. Suzuki!

272
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.220
Mr. Suzuki!

273
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:49.860
What is it?

274
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.320
I didn't think the wind would feel

275
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.340
so good.

276
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.320
Really?

277
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.660
That's good.

278
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.280
I'm Suzuki, right?

279
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:16.300
Don't run around with your sister.

280
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.340
Who are you guys chasing?

281
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.300
Mr. Honda!

282
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.780
I'm not Honda.

283
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.380
I'm Suzuki.

284
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.840
I'm sorry.

285
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.040
I didn't think you were Mr. Honda.

286
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.320
I'm Suzuki, you idiot!

287
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.940
Please forgive me, Mr. Suzuki!

288
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.080
Please forgive me, Mr. Suzuki!

289
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.460
I'm glad you understand.

290
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.160
I'll forgive you for today.

291
00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.680
But if you do that again, you'll

292
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:49.780
pay for it.

293
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.800
Are you all right?

294
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.240
If you're with me, I won't

295
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.480
be afraid.

296
00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.560
All right.

297
00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.660
Hold on tight.

298
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.500
Yes, sir.

299
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.220
That's strange.

300
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.740
I'm sure he's Mr. Honda.

301
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:33.640
Mr. Suzuki

302
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.300
is really strong and manly.

303
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.940
I'm impressed.

304
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.060
I was surprised.

305
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.160
Do you want to see a movie?

306
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.240
Yes.

307
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:52.450
The station is open.

308
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.990
I always look at it like this.

309
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.030
Don't worry about it.

310
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.590
You've changed.

311
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.140
You're the best partner.

312
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.760
The motorcycle and I are one body.

313
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.240
You're the best partner.

314
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.030
What's wrong?

315
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.730
Actually, he's going to America today.

316
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.690
Did you have a lover?

317
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.890
Are you going to America?

318
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.200
Megumi, are you going to America with

319
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.300
me?

320
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.700
No, it's nothing.

321
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.540
Two years go by quickly.

322
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.820
We'll see each other again.

323
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.450
Is that all?

324
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.290
You can go to America or wherever you

325
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:44.390
want.

326
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:45.870
Goodbye.

327
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.540
But it's okay.

328
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.080
It's over.

329
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.100
He's such a manly man.

330
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.320
I'm not going to sleep.

331
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.800
After all, men should be manly like

332
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:06.900
Mr. Suzuki.

333
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.600
I see.

334
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.900
Let's go home.

335
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.160
Yes.

336
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.400
Excuse me.

337
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.380
Welcome.

338
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.980
What's wrong?

339
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.400
Please wait here.

340
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.980
It's done.

341
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.340
It's leaking.

342
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.480
How was your date?

343
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.420
How was your date?

344
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.580
As you said, I was riding a motorcycle

345
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:47.780
all the time.

346
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:48.900
It was perfect.

347
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:49.700
I see.

348
00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.089
Megumi.

349
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.109
Mr. Yamamoto.

350
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.710
Please don't bother me.

351
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.069
Who do you think I had a date

352
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.510
with?

353
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.580
Who is that man?

354
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.140
Actually, the man I had a date with

355
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.920
is going to America today.

356
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.270
Hey, Honda.

357
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.250
Explain to me.

358
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.070
Who is he?

359
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.770
Wait, you bastard!

360
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.830
Before I leave, I want to tell you

361
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.970
how I feel.

362
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.570
Ms. Megumi.

363
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.590
I like you.

364
00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:58.710
I want to marry you.

365
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.010
I want to marry you.

366
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.950
I have a plane ticket for you.

367
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.790
I want you to come with me if

368
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:05.890
you can.

369
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.850
You said that all of a sudden.

370
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.610
That's right.

371
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.410
It's impossible, isn't it?

372
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.870
I'm always like this.

373
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.110
Well, take care.

374
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.140
You're late.

375
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.380
Do you have a passport?

376
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.680
I'm asking if you have one.

377
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.840
When we get to your house, let's

378
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.800
go on a touring with Narita next

379
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.500
time.

380
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.320
Damn it!

381
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:54.820
You bastard!

382
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.500
If I see you again, I'll arrest

383
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:56.640
you.

384
00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.500
Hey, Honda!

385
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.640
What's with Honda?

386
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.140
You like him, don't you?

387
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.440
You like Yamamoto, don't you?

388
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:06.540
I see.

389
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.120
Manliness isn't just about looks.

390
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.700
I think it's manly to keep

391
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:16.800
thinking about the woman you like all the

392
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:16.900
time.

393
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.140
Mr. Suzuki.

394
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.940
I can't believe I'm stuck in

395
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.040
a place like this.

396
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.870
What time does the plane leave?

397
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.030
7 o'clock.

398
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.050
Damn it.

399
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.610
I can't make it like this.

400
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.070
Yamamoto!

401
00:19:47.970 --> 00:20:14.940
Thank you, everyone.

402
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.180
Hey, hey.

403
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:16.880
Don't look so down.

404
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.380
If you're going to Los Angeles, that

405
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.100
means you're on the right track.

406
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.440
Well, I'm going.

407
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.320
Do your best.

408
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:31.660
Yeah.

409
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:38.410
Take care.

410
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.590
Call me from time to time.

411
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.170
Do your best.

412
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.320
Megumi.

413
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.430
Megumi.

414
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.630
Tell her.

415
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.790
I'm going with you.

416
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.550
Take me with you.

417
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.650
Megumi.

418
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.070
How long are you going to hold me?

419
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.110
If you don't hurry, you'll be

420
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.470
late.

421
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.030
Mr. Suzuki.

422
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.590
How can I thank you?

423
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.970
Can I?

424
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.390
Don't worry about me.

425
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.390
Let's go.

426
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.310
Yes.

427
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.930
Thank you very much.

428
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.550
Mr. Honda.

429
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.750
It was you.

430
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.560
Mr. Honda.

431
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.210
Goodbye, Megumi.

432
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.080
You were such a good girl.

433
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.400
Your 102nd love...

434
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.500
I know.

435
00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.160
Don't cry.

436
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.000
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.560
It's been six months.

438
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.540
It can't be helped.

439
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.620
But, Honda.

440
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.580
You're playing the role of Cupid,

441
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:08.960
the love of a woman you love.

442
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.300
You're too nice.

443
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.280
You're an idiot.

444
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.580
You're just like Ryo-san

445
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.180
when he was young.

446
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.740
Just like you, Ryo-san got

447
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.080
drunk here Dad, don't say that.

448
00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.800
Well, that's fine.

449
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.660
Hey, Honda-san.

450
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.720
Your 102nd love is so sweet.

451
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.300
Ryo-san has been seduced

452
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.360
over 300 times.

453
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:31.940
Really?

454
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.700
I feel so energetic.

455
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.620
Mr. Honda.

456
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.780
Let's drink a lot.

457
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.160
Oh, no.

458
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.700
If I get drunk, I'll get scolded

459
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.060
by my boss again.

460
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.900
It's what you always do.

461
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.440
What?

462
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.560
Damn it.

463
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.680
I'm so drunk.

464
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.020
I'll drink all the alcohol in the

465
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.120
bar.

466
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.580
Yes, Mr. Honda.

467
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:07.340
The End Thank you for coming.

468
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.140
Oh, you only serve tea, sir?

469
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.300
My cute subordinates came all the

470
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.100
way to the mountains.

471
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.180
Please treat us to something.

472
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.100

474
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:32.250
I tried to stop the clock I tried

475
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:37.630
to stop the clock But time goes by

476
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:45.350
