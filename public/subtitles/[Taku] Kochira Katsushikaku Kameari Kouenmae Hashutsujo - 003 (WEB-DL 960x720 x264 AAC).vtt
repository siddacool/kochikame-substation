00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:17.320
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Summer has come again this year.

2
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.180
Summer has come again this year.

3
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.340
Summer has come again this year.

4
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.940
Summer has come again this year.

5
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.180
What is this?

6
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.000
A meeting request?

7
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.140
A meeting?

8
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.120
Are you going to quit, senpai?

9
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.660
I don't like this, boss.

10
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.300
Boss, please call it a vacation request.

11
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.940
You idiot!

12
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.720
You're a grown-up, but you

13
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.280
don't even know how to write kan

14
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.440
ji.

15
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.540
If you're taking a vacation, are you

16
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.920
going to have a meeting?

17
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.460
Don't be silly.

18
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.960
The reason is written in detail inside.

19
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.180
Reason?

20
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.640
The reason is written in detail inside.

21
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.080
I haven't seen fireworks since I was

22
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.180
a kid.

23
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.280
You idiot!

24
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.100
Do you know what you're doing?

25
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.640
Of course, I'm a police officer.

26
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.880
Do you think it's okay for a

27
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.280
police officer to take a vacation to see

28
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.380
fireworks?

29
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.560
Fireworks are held every year.

30
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.620
I want to borrow a cat's

31
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.140
hand as a guard.

32
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.900
I can't help it.

33
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.740
Are you going to take a vacation without

34
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.840
permission?

35
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.480
If you do that, you'll be fired.

36
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.960
I'm just kidding.

37
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:05.680
The boss is annoying me every day.

38
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.440
It would be great to ride a bike

39
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.260
and see the fireworks.

40
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.220
Damn it!

41
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.360
There's no way to take a good

42
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.860
rest.

43
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.800
Hey, Ryo-san.

44
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.880
Hey.

45
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.380
I was just about to pay you back.

46
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.640
I'll pay you back.

47
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.340
Is it that bad?

48
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.760
If Ryo-san pays me back,

49
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.620
I'll be in trouble.

50
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.140
I'm one step ahead.

51
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.020
There are a lot of big mansions

52
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.960
around here.

53
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.000
Are there more people eating ramen?

54
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.960
You can't even hear the sound of

55
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.240
a charmera in a high-

56
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.340
rise apartment.

57
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.300
You can take a delivery.

58
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.380
I have a cell phone.

59
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.460
I can't.

60
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.780
I'm alone.

61
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.040
I can't get on the elevator while

62
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.140
pulling a stall.

63
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.839
It's too expensive to take a delivery

64
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.939
by helicopter.

65
00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.920
And the engine is noisy.

66
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.380
It's easier.

67
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.620
What?

68
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.650
How are you doing?

69
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.630
Kazushika Balloon Club.

70
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.570
Hey, Ryo-san.

71
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.810
You must be nervous.

72
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.810
Yeah, I'm in debt.

73
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.350
Where's the old one?

74
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.390
I put it in the warehouse.

75
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.210
I put it in the warehouse.

76
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.450
If you don't mind, can you lend

77
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.710
it to me?

78
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.230
I have a friend who is interested in

79
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.330
it.

80
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.690
Yeah, it's great to have more friends.

81
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.810
I don't mind.

82
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.640
Are you going to take a delivery on

83
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.740
this?

84
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.880
You can use the fuel as propane

85
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.140
gas.

86
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.640
Are you going to make ramen in this?

87
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.800
What do you think?

88
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.900
Hey.

89
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.940
He seems to like it.

90
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.540
He says he wants to ride it.

91
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.060
Thank you.

92
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.460
Really?

93
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.360
Let's try it.

94
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.560
It's getting bigger.

95
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.240
Remember the procedure.

96
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.780
What?

97
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.620
What do you mean?

98
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.320
We're going to pilot it.

99
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.340
What?

100
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.240
Aren't you going to ask the beard

101
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.480
ed man?

102
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.620
Do you think he'll be happy to

103
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.880
cooperate with us?

104
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.860
Besides, it's not allowed to fly at

105
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.960
night in Japan.

106
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.720
What if the bearded man finds out

107
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.360
about this plan?

108
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.540
I'm afraid the bearded man will

109
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.200
be angry.

110
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.780
He might bite me.

111
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.500
What?

112
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.980
Ryo-san, hurry up.

113
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.220
Use your hand.

114
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.040
Calm down.

115
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.740
It's flying.

116
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.600
You're a professional.

117
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.000
You're great, Tenami.

118
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.780
The basic movement of the hot air balloon

119
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.040
is adjusted with this burner.

120
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.460
It can rise to a considerable height.

121
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.300
You don't have to fly so high.

122
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.520
You can fly to the height of a

123
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.020
high-rise apartment.

124
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.900
What?

125
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.640
What?

126
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.700
When the hot air balloon rises quickly, you

127
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.480
can blow out the hot air.

128
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.440
Blow out the hot air?

129
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.040
You're enthusiastic.

130
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.820
What can I do?

131
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.020
I have a business to do.

132
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.620
A business?

133
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.000
I wanted to be a professional hot air

134
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.580
balloon pilot.

135
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.780
I wanted to fly in the sky for

136
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.660
my elementary school thesis.

137
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.160
That's what I wrote.

138
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.400
What?

139
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.980
Yes.

140
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.700
You're reliable.

141
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.800
I'll take good care of you.

142
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.140
Thank you.

143
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.240
I'm hungry.

144
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.100
The delivery is over at this time.

145
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.420
It's a hassle to go to the

146
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.520
convenience store.

147
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.560
What's that?

148
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.280
What?

149
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:59.860
It says pen.

150
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.180
No way.

151
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.500
It also has a phone number.

152
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.880
It also has a phone number.

153
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.820
I'll call to try it.

154
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.480
Yes.

155
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.540
It's Kikyu Ramen.

156
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.460
Is it a delivery?

157
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.640
What?

158
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.080
Can I have two ramen?

159
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.280
Yes.

160
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.300
Two ramen.

161
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.360
Which one?

162
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.640
It's Yamada in room 3011

163
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.560
in A.

164
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.240
It's on the 30th floor.

165
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.340
I'm at your service.

166
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.799
I was able to order it properly.

167
00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:33.960
But how can I deliver it?

168
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:45.760
It's coming closer.

169
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.960
I'm scared.

170
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.380
It's delicious.

171
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.300
Are you Yamada?

172
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.080
Yes.

173
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.520
I'm here.

174
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.140
You're fast.

175
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.700
It's in Kikyu.

176
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.800
It's a ramen shop.

177
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.540
Thank you.

178
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.560
No problem.

179
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.700
Sorry to keep you waiting.

180
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.740
It's 1,000 yen.

181
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.520
Yes.

182
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.460
It's Kikyu Ramen.

183
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:15.980
Yes.

184
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.620
Thank you.

185
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.480
Three ramen.

186
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.740
40235 in B.

187
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.520
All right.

188
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.860
It's in that room.

189
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.740
All right.

190
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.060
I got it.

191
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.120
I'll move.

192
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.660
It's coming again.

193
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.080
Yes.

194
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.020
I'll have ramen.

195
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.760
Thank you.

196
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.420
It's 700 yen.

197
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.500
It's five servings of miso

198
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:38.720
ramen.

199
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.200
Thank you.

200
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.160
I'm busy.

201
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.020
Ryo, there's a police car down

202
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.120
there.

203
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:47.900
Someone reported it.

204
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.780
What should we do?

205
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.300
Formation for the emergency!

206
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.560
It's Kikyu.

207
00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.360
Where are you?

208
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.720
It's dark and I can't see

209
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:00.840
you at all.

210
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.560
It's called the Dark Night Crow Strategy.

211
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.860
I painted Kikyu black for

212
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:06.960
this.

213
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.640
You're a bad guy.

214
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.680
If you get caught on the first day

215
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.320
of the opening, your business will go up.

216
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.300
But I didn't think you'd be

217
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:16.960
so rebellious.

218
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.060
If I make money like this, I'll

219
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.460
have a lot of ideas.

220
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.700
That's good.

221
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.740
But is it okay for you to do

222
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.460
a part-time job?

223
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.000
I'm a police officer.

224
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.640
I have a duty to help the people

225
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.120
in trouble.

226
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.480
If you're hungry at night, it's

227
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.180
the right thing to do to help people.

228
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.280
Suspicious Kikyu is mainly seen

229
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.900
around the high-rise apartment in the

230
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.000
city.

231
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.680
There's a good chance he'll show

232
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.340
up tonight.

233
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.040
Strengthen the night patrol and work on

234
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.520
the discovery.

235
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.040
Okay?

236
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.180
Do you hear me?

237
00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.660
But he's not coming out tonight, is

238
00:10:59.660 --> 00:10:59.760
he?

239
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.560
How do you know that?

240
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.520
Well, he's...

241
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.380
It's a police officer's intuition.

242
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.420
Did you have a police officer's intuition?

243
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.540
Then what do you want me to call

244
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:16.780
you?

245
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.620
A thousand yen per word?

246
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.400
You idiot!

247
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.340
Do you think it's okay for a

248
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.020
pure police officer to gamble?

249
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.160
Chief, how about this?

250
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.640
If Ryo-chan finds a clue

251
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.560
to the suspicious Kikyu, the fireworks

252
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.860
festival will be canceled.

253
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.800
Oh, I see.

254
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.420
That's good.

255
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.740
What do you think, Ryo-ts

256
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:38.840
u?

257
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.560
Do you have a problem with that?

258
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.680
That's right.

259
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.360
I'm in trouble.

260
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.000
I'm in trouble.

261
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.200
Thank you for your hard work, senpai.

262
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.040
Huh?

263
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.280
It's up there, up there.

264
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.140
Huh?

265
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.480
Why are you watching the celestial bodies while

266
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:09.580
you're on duty?

267
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.520
It's not like that.

268
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880
Then what is it?

269
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.700
Do you see a woman?

270
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.200
Well, take a look.

271
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.080
Which one?

272
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.280
Huh?

273
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.300
Why?

274
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.120
Isn't it a bird?

275
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.180
Huh?

276
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.140
It's so dark, but you can see

277
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.020
it pretty clearly.

278
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.800
It's a starlight scope used by

279
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:31.900
the US military.

280
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.120
If you look through this, you can find

281
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.080
the black, suspicious Kikyu right away.

282
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.080
Hmm.

283
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.960
It's a bad thing.

284
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.000
Oh, no.

285
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:41.960
I got a great thing.

286
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.840
Senpai, why don't you find the

287
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.860
Kikyu together and do your best?

288
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.440
I'll leave it to you.

289
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.200
Hey, what are you doing here?

290
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.960
Oh, Ryo-san.

291
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.460
Well, I always make money from Ryo

292
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.260
-san, so I thought I'd give

293
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.140
him a late-night meal.

294
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.860
Idiot.

295
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.680
What are you going to do if you

296
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:13.780
get suspicious?

297
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.700
Oh, ramen shop?

298
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:15.920
Oh, Ryo-san.

299
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.160
I'm glad.

300
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.360
I was just hungry.

301
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.260
Oh, it's my first time eating ramen

302
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:23.600
at a ramen shop, so I'd like

303
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.080
to try it.

304
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.320
It smells delicious.

305
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.100
Huh?

306
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.520
Is the ramen shop like this?

307
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.500
Huh?

308
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.380
Yeah, he's a member of the N

309
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.760
akagawa Foundation, and he's doing

310
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.340
it as a hobby.

311
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.300
He rarely eats ramen.

312
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.620
I'm not doing it as a hobby.

313
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.400
I'm not doing it as a hobby.

314
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.840
Come to think of it, the suspicious K

315
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.760
ikyu also sells ramen, right?

316
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:48.520
Huh?

317
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.740
It's ringing.

318
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.340
Oh, hello.

319
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.100
Yes, hello, Kikyu Ramen.

320
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.960
Oh, no, it's just a ramen shop.

321
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.480
Huh?

322
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.980
Just a ramen shop?

323
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.540
It's a Kikyu ramen shop,

324
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:04.940
right?

325
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.100
What time do you come around here tonight?

326
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.520
Oh, I'm sorry.

327
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:09.620
I'm sorry.

328
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.300
I'm on leave today.

329
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.000
Oh, yes.

330
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.420
Thank you again.

331
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.320
You're on leave?

332
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.260
Aren't you running a business?

333
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.940
Oh, no.

334
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.980
I was thinking of going home early tonight.

335
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.060
Right, Ryo-san?

336
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:26.960
Don't ask me.

337
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.140
I don't know anything.

338
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.280
That's right.

339
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.720
Cat air gun.

340
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.600
Three times.

341
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.360
Oh, Ryo-san.

342
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.720
I'll open it.

343
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.700
What's with the luggage?

344
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.160
You can make a lot of money with

345
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:54.260
just ramen.

346
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.940
According to the needs of the times, the

347
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.140
theory of business is to develop at a

348
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:00.240
high price.

349
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.040
It's called a flying convenience store!

350
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.460
Everyone, sorry to keep you waiting.

351
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.820
Kikyu ramen has arrived at the

352
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:21.920
convenience store.

353
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.780
Yes, Kikyu ramen at the convenience

354
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:25.880
store.

355
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.680
Oh, hello.

356
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.560
Yes, three chashu noodles, please.

357
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.540
I also got rice balls.

358
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:34.860
Good.

359
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.280
Idol Hell Limited Edition Triple Set, please.

360
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.600
Oh, I wanted this.

361
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.520
Hey, do you want an egg?

362
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.200
Yes.

363
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.080
Oh, you have everything.

364
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.360
I'll have chocolate.

365
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.840
I'll have oolong tea and

366
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.240
yakisoba.

367
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.880
Thank you.

368
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.380
I also have coffee to wake you up.

369
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.780
I'll have kaki-garli

370
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:56.880
c.

371
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.460
Yes.

372
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.200
Melon, strawberry and condensed milk.

373
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:00.940
Which would you like?

374
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.060
Oh, thank you.

375
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.380
Oh, by the way, can I have two

376
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:05.700
or three magazines?

377
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.260
Here you go.

378
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.280
You're in a hurry.

379
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.940
This is a lot of money.

380
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.480
All right, I'll catch up with you.

381
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.520
This is Nanpo.

382
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.880
I just discovered a suspicious place.

383
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.320
Where is it?

384
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:27.980
OK.

385
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.740
Kei-chan, please get the Star

386
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.940
light Scope ready.

387
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.560
Roger.

388
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.500
Anyway, I made a lot of money.

389
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:37.920
Hello.

390
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

391
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.560
It's already sold out today.

392
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:42.800
Yes.

393
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:43.640
Thank you.

394
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.120
Ryo-san, it's a mini

395
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.320
bat.

396
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.200
What?

397
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.420
What?

398
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.580
That's Komachi and Naoko.

399
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.340
All right.

400
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.740
Anti-mini bat formation, let's

401
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:55.860
go!

402
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.760
Did you turn off the neon?

403
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.200
It's all right.

404
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.800
I can see the light at the moonlight.

405
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.220
Oh, that's it.

406
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.000
It's the Starlight Scope.

407
00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.280
How is it?

408
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.400
This is the strategy.

409
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.060
It's a strategy to hide the m

410
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.160
oon.

411
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.099
Really, you work well.

412
00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:15.780
Do you work well?

413
00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.380
I can't see the moon.

414
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.020
You can see the smoke.

415
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.920
But I can't see the road.

416
00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:23.980
Damn it.

417
00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.180
Where is this?

418
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.900
I can't see it at all.

419
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.580
I'm stuck.

420
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:40.570
I thought I was going to die.

421
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.290
Bastard.

422
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.970
The balloon seems to be heading this way.

423
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.190
I can't see it at all.

424
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.470
It's okay in the dark, isn't

425
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.570
it?

426
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.190
That telescope.

427
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.610
It should be perfect up to a few

428
00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:57.710
kilometers.

429
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.930
Kei-chan, this lens.

430
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.190
What's wrong?

431
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.190
This is black paint.

432
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.530
Who did this?

433
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.690
Speaking of people who do this.

434
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.090
It's not that easy to get caught.

435
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.130
I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

436
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.030
I helped you until the day of the

437
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.130
board.

438
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.670
I'll be able to pay you back

439
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:27.770
in a little while.

440
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.210
Where is this guy?

441
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.770
Hey, it's a convenience store ramen.

442
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.970
I'd like to order.

443
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.810
What's this voice?

444
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.550
After all, Ryo-chan.

445
00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.710
It's New Year's Day today.

446
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.610
Good night.

447
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:44.830
Good night.

448
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.530
Damn it.

449
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.090
Reiko.

450
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.830
Why is this phone number?

451
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.450
There's no doubt.

452
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.550
Because it's always when Ryo-

453
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.090
chan isn't around that a suspicious balloon

454
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.190
comes out.

455
00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:58.850
If this happens.

456
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.250
I heard that the wife inspector saw it.

457
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.270
She's a good woman.

458
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.210
It looks like it's time to open

459
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:09.310
it.

460
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.430
I'm getting on my nerves.

461
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.110
It's all right.

462
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.950
I have to clean up this mountain of

463
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.050
stock.

464
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.730
Let's make a lot of money at

465
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.830
the end.

466
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.610
If it goes well, you'll be as

467
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.910
popular as the store.

468
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.750
How do you make so much money?

469
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.470
I'm going to use the fireworks festival.

470
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.550
Fireworks festival?

471
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.530
But Ryo-san.

472
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.490
Are you going to rest that day?

473
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.650
My relatives are unhappy.

474
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.430
If you make an excuse, you'll rest.

475
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.310
I have a lot of older relatives.

476
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.220
Chief.

477
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.300
Actually.

478
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.120
I know.

479
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:52.960
I know.

480
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:53.760
It's about vacation.

481
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.640
No.

482
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.280
I'm listening to the report.

483
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.780
You're looking for a suspicious balloon until

484
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:01.880
the day of the fire.

485
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.420
I'm impressed with you.

486
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.780
Tomorrow's fireworks festival is a

487
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.580
special vacation.

488
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.700
Please continue your investigation.

489
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.420
Yes.

490
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:13.900
What?

491
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.080
You don't look very happy.

492
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.240
It's no big deal.

493
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.600
I was really looking forward to the fire

494
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:33.700
works festival.

495
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.280
I can't believe that wild man.

496
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.960
Hey.

497
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.540
Isn't it a little weird?

498
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.260
Those two have been there for a while.

499
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.420
Don't you move quietly by the window?

500
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.240
No way.

501
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.880
I don't want to get in the

502
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.740
way of business.

503
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.700
Ryo-san.

504
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.920
It's time to decorate the finale.

505
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:00.600
Yes.

506
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.880
Convenience store ramen.

507
00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.460
The last sale.

508
00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.200
It's a big sale.

509
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.640
I'll make it look like a fire

510
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:06.760
work.

511
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.760
Everyone.

512
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.720
Thank you for waiting.

513
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:11.980
It's a convenience store that I'm

514
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.500
familiar with.

515
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.400
Ramen has arrived.

516
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.020
Drinking beer while looking at the fire

517
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.720
works.

518
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.660
It's the best in Japan.

519
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.660
Fireworks.

520
00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.060
Everyone in the high-rise apartment.

521
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.420
Beer.

522
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.080
Snacks.

523
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:26.800
Oysters.

524
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.740
Everything is convenient.

525
00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.640
Let's sell happiness to you.

526
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:32.840
Yes.

527
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.340
Everyone.

528
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.260
Together.

529
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.780
Come on.

530
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.560
Hey.

531
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.220
Look at this.

532
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.500
Give me shaved ice.

533
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.160
Yes.

534
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:46.820
I'm back.

535
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.860
I knew it.

536
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.160
I was beaten.

537
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.460
Ryo-san.

538
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.240
At this rate, everything will be sold out.

539
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.720
It's a big sale.

540
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.620
What's wrong?

541
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.280
The fireworks are out of order.

542
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.380
It's out of order.

543
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.020
I can't stop it.

544
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.640
Kei-chan.

545
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.100
What's the situation?

546
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.080
The ship is sinking.

547
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.080
I'm sure.

548
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.300
I knew it.

549
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.420
Stupid.

550
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.260
Fireworks.

551
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.530
I was caught up in the shock of

552
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:48.630
the fireworks.

553
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.610
It seems to be rolling.

554
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.030
I'm surprised.

555
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.910
Ryo-chan.

556
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.290
Ryo-chan.

557
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.150
Is it over?

558
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.290
No.

559
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.390
There should be 15 bullets left at the

560
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.490
end.

561
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.210
15 bullets?

562
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.190
It's 300 meters in diameter.

563
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.290
If you get caught up in it.

564
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.890
If I get caught up in it?

565
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.650
It's over.

566
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:29.190
It's a terrible end for a fool.

567
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.430
What?

568
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:33.070
What?

569
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.370
Hey.

570
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:35.590
The fireworks are making money.

571
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:37.550
It's a great service.

572
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.890
Ryo-san.

573
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.590
The money.

574
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.930
I can't help it.

575
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:43.830
I was able to see the fireworks of

576
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.490
15 bullets.

577
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.130
I'll give it to everyone as a

578
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:48.230
viewing fee.

579
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.130
I'll give it to everyone as a

580
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.430
viewing fee.

581
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.970
I won 5.

582
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.230
5 billion yen at a lottery in a

583
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.330
foreign country.

584
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.650
It's 5.

585
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:11.530
5 billion yen.

586
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.670
I bought a plastic model for a loan.

587
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:14.990
I ate an eel and a steak.

588
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.490
I can't use it all.

589
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:19.510
Next time, let's do a lottery to

590
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.150
get 1,000,000 yen.

591
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:21.710
Thank you.
