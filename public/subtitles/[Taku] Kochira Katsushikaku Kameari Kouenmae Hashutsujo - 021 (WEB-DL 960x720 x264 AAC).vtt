BATTLE Now, everyone.

24
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.420
Over the past few years, we have been

25
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.120
troubled by a certain person.

26
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.080
And that person is...

27
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.740
THIS MAN!

28
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.060
Every year, the leader of the Great

29
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
League has come up with all kinds of

30
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.020
measures to challenge this man.

31
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.780
But...

32
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.800
All of them have failed.

33
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.360
All we have left is a heavy sense

34
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.460
of defeat.

35
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.220
Sendai was just one step away.

36
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.820
I can still remember the humiliation of

37
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.920
two years ago.

38
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.800
When I think about this man, I can

39
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.720
't sleep at night because I'm so

40
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.820
frustrated.

41
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.940
But that will end this year.

42
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.280
This is the end!

43
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.460
Because I became the leader, I will definitely

44
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.940
...

45
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.040
DIE!

46
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.160
This year, I will make Ryotsu

47
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.520
Kankichi pay for his debts!

48
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.700
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you, but

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.260
you have to get inside.

50
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.640
I know.

51
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.660
And so, everyone, the 21st Ryots

52
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.100
u Kankichi Bonus Battle strategy meeting

53
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.620
is about to begin.

54
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.040
It'll be over soon.

55
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.700
Mr. Kikuchi, you know, if you

56
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.700
bring a baby to an important meeting, it

57
00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.960
'll be a problem.

58
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.680
It can't be helped.

59
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.900
My wife said, men who can't even

60
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.560
pay their debts are the worst.

61
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.200
That's why she left the house.

62
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.500
I...

63
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.200
I've been offered a deposit that R

64
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.920
yo-san won't pay.

65
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.660
But in reality, I don't think R

66
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.100
yo-san can do anything about it.

67
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.600
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.120
Your beloved father, Sato Dehiro,

69
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.660
the former manager, as the 8th president

70
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.420
of the shopping district, risked his life

71
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.980
to pay off Ryo-san's

72
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.320
debt.

73
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.700
Yeah, he was determined to do anything.

74
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.420
He was the one who started the sports

75
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.100
meeting.

76
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.980
But thanks to that, it was all in

77
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.080
vain.

78
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.160
It was a bad, bad plan.

79
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.080
That's right.

80
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.240
That's right.

81
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.060
This time, in order to get Ryo

82
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.000
-san's bonus, I've prepared a

83
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.580
new weapon.

84
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.540
A new weapon?

85
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.480
30 years of living in a plastic model

86
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.580
shop.

87
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.080
I've invested all the technology I have,

88
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.720
and spent 90% of the shopping district

89
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.900
's expenses and 3 months to develop it.

90
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.500
This is it.

91
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.100
Ryo Tsukankichi Navigation

92
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.620
System.

93
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.180
In short, Ryo Navi.

94
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.320
Everything is ready.

95
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.600
All we have to do is catch R

96
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.560
yo-san on the day and get

97
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.180
the bonus.

98
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.940
The name of the operation is the Sky

99
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.720
Eye Operation.

100
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.230
Ryo-san, Chihika

101
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.670
Ryo Tsukankichi-san.

102
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.050
Yes.

103
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.390
Here's the bonus for this time.

104
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.050
Yahoo!

105
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.350
Thinking about it, for 180 days and 2

106
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.630
days, every day, every day, I've endured

107
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.250
the boss's harassment and continued to go

108
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.810
to the police station.

109
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.910
Everything was for you, for this cute little

110
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.010
bonus.

111
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.510
Ryo-san, what are you going

112
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.750
to use for this year's bonus?

113
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.250
Actually, I've reserved a 1 in 12

114
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.730
model of the limited edition NASA-specific

115
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.170
Radicom Space Shuttle.

116
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.490
You're always like that.

117
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.870
Well, let's go to the bank right

118
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.970
away.

119
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.270
Let's go to the bank.

120
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.490
If you don't pay the deposit today,

121
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.090
it'll be canceled.

122
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.370
Even if you look at it, there are

123
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.990
30 people.

124
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.210
It's more alert than usual.

125
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.410
It's going to be hard.

126
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.010
You're late.

127
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.210
It's about time to come out.

128
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.970
It's about time to come out.

129
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.100
You're already out, aren't you?

130
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.040
Yeah.

131
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.820
People who dress up like sunglasses are easy.

132
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.480
Oh, no.

133
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.860
The bonus.

134
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.380
Hello, miss.

135
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.800
I dropped this.

136
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.580
Oh, thank you very much.

137
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.700
You're welcome.

138
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.000
What?

139
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.440
What is it?

140
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.500
I felt like you looked like a run

141
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.780
away nanny.

142
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.540
If you look closely, you're more beautiful

143
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.640
than a nanny.

144
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.900
Oh, I'm flattered.

145
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.440
Well, then.

146
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.180
Be careful.

147
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.600
That was close.

148
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.020
But these guys are a nuisance.

149
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.580
Hey, Mr. Ryo.

150
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.740
Huh?

151
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.240
I forgot my money.

152
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.960
Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.420
What?

154
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.700
Oh, no.

155
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.080
It's Mr. Ryo.

156
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.640
What?

157
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.640
Give me back my money.

158
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400
My salary.

159
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.600
What?

160
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.300
You can't do that.

161
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.660
I thought you were a good guy.

162
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.360
Take this.

163
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.820
Kumo Academy.

164
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.580
You bastard.

165
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.400
Over there.

166
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.300
I'm going to kill you.

167
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.000
Well, then.

168
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.500
I'll take the bonus.

169
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.060
It's a ramen shop.

170
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.220
What's wrong?

171
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.800
Where is it?

172
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.240
Over there.

173
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.740
When did you get here?

174
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.000
Dammit, I'm done for!

175
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.760
Ozaki-san, please respond!

176
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.120
This is Katsushika Prefecture.

177
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.480
The ambush was a failure.

178
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.760
Ryo-san has escaped.

179
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.360
Emergency action has begun.

180
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.340
Roger.

181
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.240
Ozaki-san, are you okay?

182
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.020
At this point, Ryo-san has

183
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.680
already predicted that he would escape.

184
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.320
Now is the real start of the Sky

185
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.860
Eye operation!

186
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.560
Ryo-san's belt is equipped

187
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.000
with a navigation computer.

188
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.240
The satellite is able to detect the radio

189
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.420
waves and find out where he is.

190
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.180
This is a piece of cake.

191
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.920
Will this really work?

192
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.420
The U.

193
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.520
S.

194
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.060
military uses this system, too.

195
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.220
It's more than 200% reliable.

196
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.740
But I just can't trust these new

197
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.080
machines.

198
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.180
Yes, yes.

199
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.260
Just by looking at it, you'll be

200
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.600
fine.

201
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.040
Ryo Navi, start operation.

202
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.500
Commence operation.

203
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.610
Hm?

204
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.310
What is this shining dot?

205
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.710
It's Ryo-san's current

206
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.990
location.

207
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.670
The target is heading to the Kame

208
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.650
ari Bank through the back road.

209
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.190
Go ahead and ambush him.

210
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:19.950
Roger.

211
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.230
Ryo-san, there's no point

212
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.330
in trying to escape.

213
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.990
Your location is being monitored from the sky.

214
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.630
Welcome!

215
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.090
Welcome!

216
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.130
Ryo-san, wait for me.

217
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.730
For the bonus, go to the Kame

218
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.570
ari Shopping Street.

219
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.250
Oh, no!

220
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:39.950
He's ahead of us!

221
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.550
All right!

222
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.270
Street Riders, move out!

223
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.310
I'm counting on you!

224
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.130
Damn it!

225
00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.310
I'll show you the skills of a

226
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.410
motorcycle I just trained in the front!

227
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.090
You even prepared a motorcycle?

228
00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.710
You even prepared a motorcycle?

229
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.010
You're a weirdo!

230
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.550
Buddy!

231
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.410
You're charging too fast!

232
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:12.670
Hm?

233
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.330
Don't be naive, Ryo-san!

234
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.190
I used to be a professional racer!

235
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.750
I've been told so many times that

236
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.310
I can't even hear myself!

237
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.760
Hello?

238
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.900
Street Riders have been wiped

239
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.000
out.

240
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.000
He's going to cross the Nakaga

241
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.420
wa River and go to the next town.

242
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.840
Ryo-san is heading to the

243
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.120
next town.

244
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.000
Shoot him in the middle of the bridge.

245
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.420
Damn it!

246
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.220
They're really going all out this year!

247
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.720
It's safer to leave the town and

248
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.900
go to the bank in the next town.

249
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.320
Yeah.

250
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:53.840
Huh?

251
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.640
You can't go through here, Ryo

252
00:09:59.640 --> 00:09:59.920
-san!

253
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.200
N-No way!

254
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.640
How did you know where to go?

255
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:04.480
Huh?

256
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.920
Ryo-san, there's no way

257
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.020
out.

258
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.620
What's going on?

259
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.080
Give me a bonus!

260
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.860
Give Ryo-san a bonus!

261
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.580
Everyone!

262
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.000
Bonus!

263
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.440
Bonus!

264
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.800
Bonus!

265
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.360
Bonus!

266
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.820
Bonus!

267
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:26.640
Bonus!

268
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.120
Damn it!

269
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.560
I'm not going to let you!

270
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:38.980
He can't be jumping into the river

271
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.460
in midwinter!

272
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.200
He's running away!

273
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.340
Wait, you...

274
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.240
Let go!

275
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.600
Let go!

276
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:46.960
We're humans!

277
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.180
If you jump into the water, you'll

278
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.440
die!

279
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:50.780
Let go!

280
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.280
Here.

281
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600
What are you doing?

282
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.220
Did you drop this miserable gate

283
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.520
ball?

284
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.100
Or is it the Nagashima Sh

285
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.060
igeo's ball?

286
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.720
Nagashima's sign ball.

287
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.820
Of course it's the gate ball!

288
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.280
Of course I'm going to do it!

289
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.500
I'm going to borrow some fire.

290
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.840
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

291
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.440
Darn it.

292
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.300
How does he know where I'm going?

293
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.400
What's this code?

294
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.500
A battery in a case?

295
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:31.920
Ah!

296
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.700
He was monitoring me with a navigation system!

297
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.720
That's a good idea.

298
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.600
But I'm not going to get caught

299
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:38.700
that easily.

300
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.780
I have an important mission.

301
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.560
I have to go to the ban

302
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.060
k and deposit the money Idiot!

303
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.880
Idiot!

304
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.860
What's an idiot?

305
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.180
Idiot!

306
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.060
Idiot!

307
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.720
Oh, that's right.

308
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.920
My pot isn't so weak that it

309
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.450
could break just by jumping into the river.

310
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.610
Are you sure this is where Ryo

311
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:08.870
is?

312
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.750
I can't trust you at all.

313
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.590
Hey, Mr. Ohara.

314
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:17.870
How is it?

315
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.530
Did you catch Ryo?

316
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.630
It's a matter of time.

317
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.270
This is all thanks to Mr. Ohara

318
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.350
's help.

319
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:24.510
It's a piece of cake to replace

320
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.250
Ryo's belt.

321
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.570
I can't cause any more trouble to

322
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.370
you No, no.

323
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.910
Please feel free to stay on the big

324
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.010
boat.

325
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:49.270
Thank you.

326
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:50.710
Mr. Ozaki!

327
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.290
What is it, Grandma?

328
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.630
You haven't been moving for a while

329
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:54.730
now.

330
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:55.950
Did you break something?

331
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.310
No, I didn't.

332
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.610
It's closed.

333
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.150
It looks like he ran away and is

334
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.830
taking a break.

335
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.590
Mr. Ohara.

336
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.990
I'll put the last of Ryo

337
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.370
on the rice.

338
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.550
Oh!

339
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:09.710
Is it finally time?

340
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.670
Please get on.

341
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.430
Yes!

342
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.350
All units, all units!

343
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.130
Ryo is currently in the final stages

344
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.390
of the operation to defeat the Kame

345
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.050
hameha Hybrid.

346
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.380
All units, to the hotel!

347
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:41.090
Is R

348
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.010
yo here?

349
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.790
I can't trust the latest technology.

350
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.870
This option CD-ROM synchronizes

351
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.110
with the radio waves from the satellite and

352
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.550
finds Ryo's location in the hotel

353
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.650
in the nick of time.

354
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.410
All units!

355
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.810
Ryo is in the 817th

356
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.450
room on the veranda.

357
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.050
A is in the 816th room

358
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.470
on the veranda.

359
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.870
B is in the 818th room

360
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.290
on the veranda.

361
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.110
C and D are in the 817

362
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.230
th room on the veranda.

363
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.550
The Kamehameha Hybrid's

364
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.410
survival depends on this battle.

365
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.370
All units, do your best!

366
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.950
Make sure you win!

367
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.450
Yuki, we're finally a team.

368
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.330
Mr. Tsutsumi.

369
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.090
Mr. Tsutsumi.

370
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.470
B is in position.

371
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.610
Go ahead, B.

372
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.650
B is in the 818th room

373
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:43.290
on the veranda.

374
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.090
C and D are in position.

375
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.950
C and D are in position.

376
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.210
Roger.

377
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.730
Countdown begins.

378
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.870
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

379
00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:58.710
Charge!

380
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:00.650
Charge!

381
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:08.740
Report.

382
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.620
Did you succeed in capturing the target?

383
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.160
C-Crow!

384
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.100
Crow?

385
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.400
The one on the veranda isn't

386
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:17.700
Ryo.

387
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.780
It's a crow with Ryo's

388
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.420
belt on it.

389
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.940
N-No way.

390
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.560
I can't believe our strategy

391
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:24.820
worked.

392
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.820
That's why I said you can't

393
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.300
trust machines.

394
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.580
Looks like I won this time, too.

395
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.580
Now, it's time to wash the cash.

396
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.780
Oh, there's money on the floor.

397
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.460
Money?

398
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.720
Money, money, money, money!

399
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.880
Oh, I found it.

400
00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.020
I got it.

401
00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.740
A children's bank?

402
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.080
A children's bank?

403
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.700
Damn it!

404
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.860
I didn't trick you!

405
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.240
See?

406
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.900
I didn't have to use the machine

407
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.140
many times to catch you.

408
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.700
Y-You're right.

409
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.760
This might be the best way for R

410
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:11.860
yo.

411
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.320
As expected of a child.

412
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.240
Pathetic.

413
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.540
What have I been doing all this time?

414
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.500
Come on, line up.

415
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.100
Is that okay, Mr. Ohara?

416
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.180
Here you go.

417
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.320
Please take it.

418
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.040
Sorry, Ryo.

419
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:30.900
I'll take it.

420
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:31.660
Yeah.

421
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:32.720
What's wrong?

422
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.160
You don't look well.

423
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.200
It's my fault for not paying you.

424
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.000
Just take it.

425
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.920
Oh, really?

426
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.540
You don't feel well when I say

427
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:41.720
that, do you?

428
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.120
I'm sorry, Sachiko.

429
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.660
I think I can still catch up with

430
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.040
you.

431
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.720
Who's that girl?

432
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.100
She's my little sister, Sachiko.

433
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:51.200
That's right.

434
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.380
Sachiko is working in a cold country

435
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.720
where her limbs are numb and her bones

436
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.220
are frozen.

437
00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.460
What?

438
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.140
She's still a child.

439
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.620
Why is that?

440
00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:05.119
It's a long story.

441
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.980
I'll never forget it.

442
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.339
Sachiko was born on a snowy,

443
00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.319
cold night.

444
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.319
Her father and mother were happy.

445
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.839
They wished her to grow up to be

446
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:16.939
a happy child.

447
00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:18.940
That's why they named her Sachiko.

448
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.079
But...

449
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.020
Her parents died in an accident.

450
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.780
The insurance money that was supposed to cover

451
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.420
it was stolen by a bad broker.

452
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.100
The house collapsed as if

453
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.200
it were being chased.

454
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.560
On top of that, Sachiko's parents

455
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:48.660
died.

456
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.500
Her business failed and she had to pay

457
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:50.980
a debt of 200 million yen.

458
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.600
Her relative, who helped her pay the debt,

459
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.280
took her away.

460
00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.020
But...

461
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.560
Her relative was actually the president of a

462
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.540
bad construction company.

463
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.100
He forced her to work even when she

464
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.200
was a child.

465
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.680
He didn't even let her eat properly.

466
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.720
I tried to get her back, but every

467
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.400
time I tried, I got a 200 million

468
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.020
yen fine.

469
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.640
And then I made up my mind.

470
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.140
If I had just worked hard, I wouldn

471
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.780
't have made it before Sachiko grew

472
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.440
up.

473
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.020
I would have spent all my salary and

474
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.160
bonuses on debt repayment.

475
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.320
I don't care how much people in

476
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.580
the world hate me for that.

477
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.020
But my brother was wrong.

478
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.720
Even though you're poor, you caused so

479
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.600
much trouble for so many people.

480
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.480
You should be ashamed of yoursel

481
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:45.580
f!

482
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.320
I see.

483
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.540
So that's what happened.

484
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.320
I didn't even know that.

485
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.440
Please forgive me for calling you a human

486
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:53.880
scum.

487
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.280
It's okay, Bujo.

488
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.660
Everyone, I may have done it the wrong

489
00:18:59.660 --> 00:18:59.820
way.

490
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.060
But he was trying to live his life

491
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.600
as a human being.

492
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.220
Please forgive him on behalf of Oha

493
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.880
ra Daijirou.

494
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.240
Please forgive him on behalf of Oha

495
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.700
ra Daijirou.

496
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.840
I'm the one who should be forgiven.

497
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:13.500
I didn't even think about Ryo

498
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.160
's situation.

499
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:15.700
I was just trying to get a bonus.

500
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.540
Here, Ryo.

501
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.080
This is your bonus.

502
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.720
Hurry up and give it to your sister.

503
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.880
But this is...

504
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.320
I don't care about the debt.

505
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.480
I'm a million times happier than R

506
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:34.580
yo.

507
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.100
Ryo!

508
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.500
Don't lose!

509
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.400
I'll never forget your kindness.

510
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.640
I'm sure your sister will be happy,

511
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.640
too.

512
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500
Hello, everyone.

513
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.880
What's going on?

514
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.780
Oh, what's this?

515
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.500
That's Ryo's sister, Sachiko.

516
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.060
That's strange.

517
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.500
This is just a part of the magazine.

518
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.880
And you don't have a sister, do

519
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:01.980
you?

520
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.260
No, I don't.

521
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:02.840
What?

522
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.400
No!

523
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.290
If Ryo gets caught up in that,

524
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:08.990
it's impossible for him to get my

525
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.410
bonus.

526
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.050
Thank you very much.

527
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.190
Now, all I have to do is go

528
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.950
to the bank.

529
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.730
What the hell is this?

530
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.630
Who did this to you?

531
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:31.150
According to past data, you have a 95

532
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.130
% chance of getting caught up in this

533
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:33.790
coffee shop.

534
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.250
Just as I thought.

535
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:38.450
It was worth the wait.

536
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.390
What are you wearing?

537
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.330
This is the debt-collecting

538
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.450
weapon for Ryo Tsukankichi.

539
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.150
Debt-X.

540
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.710
Debt-X?

541
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.110
It was secretly developed for next year's

542
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.770
bonus race.

543
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.730
It's already 80% complete.

544
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.050
I knew it.

545
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.530
According to my calculations, I should be able

546
00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.710
to beat you with this.

547
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.120
Connecting with this Debt-X

548
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:08.960
...

549
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.920
That's Ryo for you!

550
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.060
I got it!

551
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.520
This won't do!

552
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.080
Electric Shock!

553
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:27.680
Take this!

554
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.800
Don't worry.

555
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.060
Considering your physical strength, I'll set the

556
00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.180
voltage so that you won't die.

557
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.360
Well, you'll probably faint, but...

558
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.300
Electric Shock!

559
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.800
Electric Shock!

560
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.180
My bonus!

561
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.900
I don't want to do something like

562
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.000
this.

563
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.760
It's your fault for not paying the

564
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:02.860
debt.

565
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.620
Anyway, I'll take your bonus.

566
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:08.960
What's wrong?

567
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:09.940
Huh?

568
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.120
I was so close!

569
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:23.750
Damn it!

570
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:25.850
Now you know!

571
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.210
It's impossible for you to take my

572
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:27.550
bonus!

573
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.710
Even if the boss allows it, God won

574
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.090
't allow it!

575
00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.210
As I thought, God won't...

576
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:41.850
Wait!

577
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:43.890
Wait, wait!

578
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.210
Give it to me first!

579
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.250

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.460
If there's any money left in the

585
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.380
bank, he'll give it to me.

586
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.260
That's a lot of work.

587
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.200
Ryo, if you want to pay the

588
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.000
debt, I can help you.

Stop talking!

591
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.920
It requires concentration.

600
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.470
or body, but his heart!

601
