(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Receiving the wind of the coming season

2
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.560
The shining, best carnival Lightly passing

3
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.940
through the rough times Let's go, to

4
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.820
the city by myself, diving I wanna dive

5
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.120
in paradise Rather than looking at all the

6
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.580
trends I'm gonna steal as much

7
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.860
as I like, so Ready, set, go!

8
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.700
Everybody can do!

9
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.860
I've started running, my dream never stops

10
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.760
I'm strong enough to face tomorrow's

11
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.400
regret Everybody can do!

12
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.600
Even if it's a little dark, I

13
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.460
don't want to look I'm strong

14
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:30.710
enough to face the rising curiosity Battle

15
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:46.470
Cards of the New Year All

16
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.150
right, it's done!

17
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870
Thank you for your hard work.

18
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.810
We'll take care of the rest.

19
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.050
Thank you for your hard work.

20
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.310
Ryo-san, I heard you've

21
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.070
been on duty since New Year's

22
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.170
Eve.

23
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.950
Of course.

24
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.890
Unlike Nakagawa and Reiko, I

25
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.830
put my life on the line.

26
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.250
Even during the New Year's holiday, I

27
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.610
was on duty to protect the safety of

28
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:09.710
the people.

29
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.390
What's so funny?

30
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.830
Ryo-san, don't joke with

31
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.230
your eyebrows.

32
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.710
What?

33
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.110
I know.

34
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.110
You took too many summer vacations last

35
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.150
year, and you've been filling them up

36
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.250
for the New Year.

37
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.150
You guys knew, didn't you?

38
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.870
Well, I'm going home.

39
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.290
Ryo-san, what are you going

40
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.690
to do from now on?

41
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.510
I'm just going to sleep in the

42
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.610
cold.

43
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.930
There's no New Year's party at

44
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.030
the head officer's house this

45
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.130
year.

46
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.990
Huh?

47
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.610
That's strange.

48
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.710
You're right.

49
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.570
I met Terai at Hatsum

50
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.670
ode yesterday.

51
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.350
He said he was going to the head

52
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.130
officer's house for New Year

53
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.450
's Eve.

54
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.710
That's a mistake.

55
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.530
The head officer said he was

56
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.090
going on a family trip with his parents.

57
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.030
New Year's party?

58
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.650
Yes, it's an old New Year's

59
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.810
party at the head officer's

60
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.910
house.

61
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.830
When are you doing it next year?

62
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.950
Next year is canceled.

63
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.870
I was looking forward to eating New Year

64
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.870
's food at the head officer

65
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.970
's house.

66
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.030
Ryo-chan, you're exaggerating.

67
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.950
Well, don't be so disappointed.

68
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.150
It's been a while since the three

69
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.210
of us went on a hot spring trip.

70
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.370
You're going to take care of your

71
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.630
family more than your subordinates, aren

72
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.730
't you?

73
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.850
Don't say that.

74
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.450
Hiromi is old, and he can't

75
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.650
go on a trip with his parents.

76
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.750
I can't go on a trip to

77
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.150
Mizuirazu many times.

78
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.990
Well, that's what it is.

79
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.850
Everyone, let's have a New Year's

80
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.530
party next year.

81
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.010
Yes, sir.

82
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.690
I'm really sorry.

83
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.450
Now that I think about it, I feel

84
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.710
like everyone was very unnatural.

85
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.550
Maybe I'm the only one who wasn

86
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.130
't invited.

87
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.990
All right.

88
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.270
Is this the head officer's

89
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.490
house?

90
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.950
I'm Ryo-chan.

91
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.070
It's nice to meet you.

92
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.210
By the way, I have something to do

93
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.310
with the head officer.

94
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.890
What?

95
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.050
You did it.

96
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.990
The head officer made a fool

97
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.270
of me.

98
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.910
Damn it.

99
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.810
Then I'll give you a feast.

100
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.630
I won't forgive you.

101
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.090
Ryo-san, I don't have

102
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.970
a chance right now.

103
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.150
Don't look at the blood.

104
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.690
Happy New Year.

105
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.310
Happy New Year.

106
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.050
Thank you for coming.

107
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.550
I look forward to working with you again

108
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.650
this year.

109
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.990
Hiromi-chan, you're cute.

110
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.610
Reiko-san, you look good too.

111
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.850
Thank you.

112
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.990
What?

113
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.630
Isn't the head officer here

114
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.810
yet?

115
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.700
You know, Dad...

116
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.040
Hiromi, I don't even want to

117
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.760
think about that guy since New Year's.

118
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.640
By the way, Nakagawa, did you

119
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.160
park the car in front of the house?

120
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.200
Yes, sir.

121
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.640
Come on, come on.

122
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.540
It's a small place, but come on

123
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.640
in.

124
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.200
What?

125
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.300
Head officer, why are you closing

126
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.840
the window in the middle of the day?

127
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.180
I guess it's a devil's charm.

128
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.200
Devil's charm?

129
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.240
Senpai, please forgive me.

130
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.960
I'm going to the first shrine visit

131
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.600
with my sister from now on.

132
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.400
You can go to the first shrine visit

133
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.500
anytime, but today is the only New Year

134
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.740
's party for the head officer.

135
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.520
That's messed up.

136
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.920
Don't you regret it?

137
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.140
You're not invited to the New Year

138
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.060
's party either.

139
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.420
Of course.

140
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.860
I'm not on duty at the police

141
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.960
station.

142
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.200
Don't talk about the details.

143
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.520
I'm your best friend, so you can

144
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.080
take me to the head officer

145
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.380
's house.

146
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.040
What?

147
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.260
You're a tough guy early in the

148
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.360
New Year.

149
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.700
All right, get on with it.

150
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.720
Let's go!

151
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:43.200
Oh, I

152
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.460
'm sorry.

153
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.480
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

154
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.740
Isn't that Honda's CBX engine?

155
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.000
Maybe Senpai's here, too.

156
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.800
What?

157
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.560
He's already here.

158
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.720
As expected, the devil's charm works well.

159
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.340
Listen, no matter what happens, don't say

160
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.380
a word or show up.

161
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.460
That's right, you've decided to stay

162
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.560
out of it.

163
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.960
I thought you went on a family trip.

164
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.980
That's not possible.

165
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.720
Look at that.

166
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.300
What's that?

167
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.500
You're using your clumsy hand to chase

168
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.600
me with a sheet.

169
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.360
It's a Ferrari F50.

170
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.900
It's different from the one I always

171
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.760
ride, but it's definitely a Nakag

172
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.420
awa Ferrari.

173
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.340
Is that so?

174
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.420
Maybe it's a car from a neighbor.

175
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.780
Look around you.

176
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.440
Where the hell do people live?

177
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.260
Look at the license plate, too.

178
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.740
It's a boy's number.

179
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.440
Nakagawa lives in Tokyo, but he

180
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.620
's dressed up and has a boy's

181
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.100
number on all his cars.

182
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.440
Yes, sir!

183
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.400
Ohara-san?

184
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.000
It's a delivery.

185
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.780
I'd like a box, please.

186
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.840
Ohara-san, please come out.

187
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.480
Ryo-chan, you're so obvious.

188
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.340
I don't know what to do.

189
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.060
Damn it, I'm just going to let

190
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:28.600
him through.

191
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:28.880
What's going on?

192
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.720
The curtains are closed.

193
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.640
He's on a long trip.

194
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.020
The enemy is still inside.

195
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.020
Look at this.

196
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.960
Isn't this just an electric meter?

197
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.560
Look closely at the meter.

198
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.360
If you're out, you should only have

199
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.400
a refrigerator and a phone.

200
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.080
That's why the meter doesn't work.

201
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.340
I see.

202
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.820
Everyone, would you like some sukiy

203
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.000
aki?

204
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.360
That sounds good.

205
00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:58.920
I was just getting tired of your food.

206
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.680
I'll help you.

207
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.780
Boss!

208
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.960
I know you're in there.

209
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.040
He's a persistent guy.

210
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.120
Put us in there quickly.

211
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.040
I feel sorry for him.

212
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.180
Put him in there.

213
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:14.420
No!

214
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.880
You may not know this, but he messed

215
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.420
up the house on New Year's Eve.

216
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.960
I'll never let him in there again.

217
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.540
I don't know if I should let

218
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:38.640
him in there.

219
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.480
You're completely surrounded.

220
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.380
Give up and come out.

221
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.760
Ignore him.

222
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.120
He's not reacting at all.

223
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.800
Damn it!

224
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.720
If that's what you're going to

225
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.580
do, let's do it with the back

226
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:54.880
of our hands.

227
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.580
The back of our hands?

228
00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.260
It's quiet now.

229
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.400
It looks like you've given up.

230
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.060
No, when it comes to food, I'll

231
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.340
show you a terrible obsession, so you can

232
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:08.880
't rest assured.

233
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.040
Oh!

234
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.200
A power outage?

235
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.180
There's no way we're going to

236
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.780
do electrical work on New Year's.

237
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.860
Honey, the gas in the kitchen stopped all

238
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:17.960
of a sudden.

239
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.800
What did you say?

240
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.480
Damn it!

241
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.660
It's all Ryo's fault!

242
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.120
Senpai, let's stop here.

243
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.060
Shut up!

244
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.580
If that's what you're going to

245
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.620
do, I'll eat you alive!

246
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.220
Oh...

247
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.320
Still, you're stubborn.

248
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.460
It's good to make the water flow

249
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.600
backwards and make them panic, but you'd

250
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.080
better break the door as soon as possible!

251
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.260
Wait a minute, Senpai!

252
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.320
Senpai, the chainsaw is bad.

253
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.940
Honda, it's okay.

254
00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:55.900
Don't worry.

255
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:56.900
Huh?

256
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.340
For the time being, it's only the

257
00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.640
minimum power that's broken.

258
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.580
I can't rest assured at all.

259
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.400
Let's go!

260
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.500
Ryo!

261
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.320
Chief!

262
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.600
Don't open it all of a sudden!

263
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.280
We're running out of time!

264
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.780
I'm the one who's running out

265
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:24.880
of time!

266
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.820
Senpai, what are you doing here with

267
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:29.920
a chainsaw?

268
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.300
The door...

269
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.800
No, uh...

270
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.520
The chief asked me to take care of

271
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:34.620
the plants.

272
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:36.900
Liar!

273
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.460
I don't remember asking you to do

274
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:39.560
that!

275
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.740
I don't like it.

276
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.100
When I get older, I forget.

277
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.520
Right, Honda?

278
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.420
Yes.

279
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.700
Oh, no, no, no!

280
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.120
Anyway, Chief, didn't you go on a

281
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.740
hot spring trip?

282
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:51.860
What?

283
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.680
Oh, that's...

284
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.000
I couldn't get a ticke

285
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.040
t because of the travel agency, so I

286
00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.560
ended up staying at home.

287
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.920
Then why is Nakagawa there?

288
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.060
Huh?

289
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.760
I mean, I was suddenly bored, so I

290
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.860
called Nakagawa and Reiko.

291
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.000
Of course, I also contacted you and Nico

292
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.560
Nico Ryo, but...

293
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.300
Unfortunately, they're not here.

294
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.640
Isn't that obvious?

295
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.620
I've always been on a business trip.

296
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.500
I-Is that so?

297
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.720
I was careless.

298
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.100
Huh?

299
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.000
Well, it was a coincidence.

300
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.040
Let's stop by, Honda.

301
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.960
Chief, of course you don't mind, do

302
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.060
you?

303
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.360
Oh, that's great, Honda.

304
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.080
You came all the way to Chiba

305
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.120
to take care of the plants.

306
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.680
Well then, let's have a meal.

307
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.220
Oh, before that...

308
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

309
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.720
You came to take care of the plants,

310
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.780
so you're prepared.

311
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.860
I brought it so that I wouldn't

312
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:57.960
have any trouble with this.

313
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.860
Honda, that outfit is a little rude.

314
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.820
Oh, well, it's the chief's house.

315
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.860
Ryoichi, remember what to do.

316
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.950
Ryoichi, Honda.

317
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.050
Happy New Year.

318
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.350
Come on, sit down.

319
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.410
Thank you.

320
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.510
Hello, everyone.

321
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.170
Happy New Year.

322
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.750
H-Happy New Year.

323
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.590
That's great.

324
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.730
You look good in your Japanese clothes.

325
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.310
W-Why do you say that?

326
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.850
If you're going to come to the

327
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.590
New Year party in such a nice kim

328
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.110
ono, why don't you at least say

329
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.350
a few words to me?

330
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.910
Honda, I'm really happy to have such

331
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:51.550
a good colleague.

332
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.790
S-Senpai...

333
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.110
Ryoichi, stop being so sarcastic.

334
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.370
What did you say?

335
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.310
Well, well, it's the New Year, so

336
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.730
let's have fun.

337
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.870
I'm tired of New Year's food,

338
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.310
so I thought I'd make some su

339
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.650
kiyaki.

340
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.470
What do you guys think?

341
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.790
What kind of stupid thing are you doing?

342
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.110
We eat New Year's food.

343
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.290
This is the Japanese custom, isn't it,

344
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:18.610
Chief?

345
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.650
But...

346
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.570
There's no such thing as New Year

347
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.270
's food for nothing.

348
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.250
In order to let the housewife rest

349
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.550
for the New Year, we put in a

350
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.930
lot of effort into the New Year without

351
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:29.570
doing any housework.

352
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.010
It's the Japanese custom to eat New

353
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.110
Year's food.

354
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.570
But it's not like you're going

355
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.410
to do anything, is it, Ryoichi?

356
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.170
Even if it's New Year's food,

357
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.550
we're going to have a lot of

358
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.650
fun.

359
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.230
Black beans are good for the beans.

360
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.490
Shrimps are good for the

361
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:47.410
shrimps, and so on.

362
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.830
There's a lot of meaning to it.

363
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.830
And you're going to make suki

364
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.210
yaki out of New Year's food?

365
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.590
What are you thinking?

366
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.710
New Year's food in Japan is always

367
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.610
New Year's food!

368
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.390
It looks like he's here to see

369
00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.730
the New Year's food, so it looks

370
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.390
like we should give it to him.

371
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.310
It seems so.

372
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.790
Mom, there's still New Year's food,

373
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:05.870
right?

374
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.210
Give me that.

375
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.150
Yes, sir.

376
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:09.570
Yay!

377
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.950
New Year's food is here!

378
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.330
We're going to make sukiy

379
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.350
aki here, so you can eat New Year

380
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.950
's food there, Ryoichi.

381
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:16.630
Huh?

382
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.120
Another stranger?

383
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.060
Well, as long as New Year's food

384
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.860
comes, it's fine.

385
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.500
Oh, here it is.

386
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.080
Here you go.

387
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.500
Thank you.

388
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.900
What?

389
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.900
I don't see Kinton-kun

390
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.880
or Kazunoko-san.

391
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.880
I ate that.

392
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.060
That's all that's left.

393
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.000
Huh?

394
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.220
Black beans?

395
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.180
Kobumaki?

396
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.440
Kamaboko?

397
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.120
I guess the unpopular best three of

398
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.720
the New Year's food were left behind.

399
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.320
New Year's food without the main character

400
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.300
doesn't taste good at all.

401
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.120
It looks delicious.

402
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.720
All right, it's starting to boil.

403
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.100
Um, boss.

404
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.760
Let's eat.

405
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.040
Thank you for the food.

406
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.760
Um, boss.

407
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.260
What?

408
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720
If you don't mind, would you like

409
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.520
to help with the sukiyaki

410
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:15.700
over there?

411
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.620
I made New Year's food for you.

412
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.860
Ryoichi, until you finish eating New

413
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.380
Year's food, I'll leave the su

414
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.120
kiyaki to you.

415
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.740
Kazuke-san.

416
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.000
I understand.

417
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.560
I just have to eat the suki

418
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.020
yaki, right?

419
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.060
Of course.

420
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.340
That's great.

421
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.200
I don't know what to do with

422
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.300
the rest of the sukiyaki.

423
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.320
It's perfect for New Year's food.

424
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.820
Ryoichi's stomach is as big

425
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.160
as a caterpillar.

426
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.100
That's right.

427
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.240
I'll introduce you to the ones that

428
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.340
are a little damaged.

429
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.860
Anyway, you'd better eat the meat before

430
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.200
Ryoichi finishes eating the suki

431
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:47.300
yaki.

432
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.100
Yes, sir.

433
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.420
I can finally eat the sukiy

434
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:56.620
aki.

435
00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.020
Thank you for the food.

436
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.260
There's only one piece of meat.

437
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.980
Damn it.

438
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.619
What?

439
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.640
I'm sorry.

440
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.260
I was faster.

441
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.450
No, I was faster.

442
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.099
Honda, right?

443
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.140
Honda, I'll tell you clearly.

444
00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.800
No, I'm sorry.

445
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.920
It's better to eat meat when you

446
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.020
're older.

447
00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:24.920
It's good for your health.

448
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.820
You ate a lot of sukiy

449
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.060
aki, so don't worry about it.

450
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.380
Damn it.

451
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.680
You can't put your teeth in the

452
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:37.780
meat.

453
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.640
I know what you're going to do.

454
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.340
You two aren't kids.

455
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.140
That's right.

456
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.160
The winner will eat it.

457
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.100
Winner?

458
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.360
It's New Year's Eve.

459
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.700
Why don't we play a card game?

460
00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.200
That sounds fun.

461
00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.560
All right.

462
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.660
I remember there was a police card game.

463
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.360
A police card game?

464
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.540
I played it with my sister yesterday.

465
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.860
If you walk in the police station, you

466
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.100
'll be in trouble.

467
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.460
Um...

468
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.660
If you're not careful, you'll get

469
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:10.820
hurt.

470
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.460
That's a good one, isn't it?

471
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.060
A card game like that isn't fun.

472
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.180
What do you think?

473
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.840
Let's play my card game.

474
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.520
Did you bring your card?

475
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:22.800
Yes.

476
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.960
I made it for New Year's Eve.

477
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.480
You're on duty.

478
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.620
Are you going to play a card game?

479
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.680
Aren't you going to play?

480
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.380
Let's do it.

481
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.440
I'm not going to let you eat

482
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:37.540
the meat.

483
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.540
No, I'll be the last one to

484
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.180
eat the meat.

485
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.880
I'll eat it.

486
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.500
Then I'll go.

487
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.620
I'll go.

488
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.200
What's the matter?

489
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.580
Aren't you going to read it?

490
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.860
I can't read it.

491
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.960
Mr. Nakagawa, please read it for

492
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.060
me.

493
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:57.840
What?

494
00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.220
Anyone is fine.

495
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.220
Hurry up and read it.

496
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.660
All right.

497
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.280
Um...

498
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.880
Reiko's big pie that will fall

499
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:05.980
someday.

500
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.140
What did you say?

501
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.360
No, I...

502
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:09.640
Yes!

503
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.060
Chief, you drank it first, right?

504
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.160
What are you talking about?

505
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.740
You idiot.

506
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.040
I'll go next.

507
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.880
That's definitely the chief.

508
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.020
Ryotsu Tankichi What?

509
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.140
I like this card the most.

510
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.580
It's a mess of a card because

511
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:37.680
I made it.

512
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.460
Haraguroi Chief Ohara is

513
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.020
a shimitare.

514
00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.120
What?

515
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.320
Yes!

516
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.260
It was right in front of me, but

517
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:47.760
it was a shame.

518
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.720
My Home Terai-kun of Lon

519
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.360
jidoku Not yet.

520
00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.240
I found it!

521
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.260
You're so naive, Chief.

522
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.820
It doesn't seem to be my enemy.

523
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.980
It's a mess of a card.

524
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.240
I made it myself, so you're definitely

525
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:11.600
in the lead.

526
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.740
Are you going to make a mess of

527
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:14.840
it because you lost?

528
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.700
That's not it.

529
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.200
It's hard to read because it's

530
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.300
dirty.

531
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.360
It's unfair that you're the only

532
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:20.860
one who doesn't know.

533
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:24.860
Chief.

534
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.280
Where are you going with the card?

535
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.220
I'm making it fair.

536
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.260
It's a mess.

537
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.000
Are you going to scatter it all over

538
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.100
the house?

539
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.640
This is fair.

540
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:38.940
This is it, right?

541
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.260
All right, this is fine.

542
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.460
We'll find out what Nakagawa

543
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.660
is reading here.

544
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.080
If we find it, we'll bring it

545
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.460
to Nakagawa and have him check

546
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:51.960
it out.

547
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.060
It sounds like fun.

548
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.040
All right, let's get started.

549
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.440
Yes.

550
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.120
Nakagawa-kun is a police

551
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.320
officer who does it as a hobby.

552
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.080
Not yet.

553
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.480
All right, I found it.

554
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.080
Damn it!

555
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.480
Ryo-tsu, Kan-k

556
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.360
ichi, the best man in Kameari.

557
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.300
Honda-kun, who has more heartbreak

558
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.340
than Tora-san.

559
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.600
You did it, Ryo-tsu.

560
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.140
A big fever.

561
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.340
Chief, you should raise your salary rather than

562
00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:25.440
raise your blood pressure.

563
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.420
Ryo-tsu has 20.

564
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.620
The chief has 19.

565
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.100
There are two more cards left.

566
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.340
I can't stand losing to Ryo

567
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:35.660
-tsu.

568
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.980
I remember this.

569
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.240
There's a toilet.

570
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.340
It's on the second floor of the

571
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:43.520
library.

572
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.620
Don't just eat bento boxes.

573
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.100
Toilet!

574
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.100
Damn it!

575
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.280
I found it!

576
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.340
Now I win!

577
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.400
Now we're even.

578
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.400
You're using dirty tricks!

579
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.560
All right, here's the last card.

580
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.020
Here I go.

581
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.180
I'm going to turn things around.

582
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.700
This year, right?

583
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.040
I didn't even read it.

584
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.020
Now I win!

585
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.080
What?

586
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.320
It won't open.

587
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.880
You're too naive, Ryo-ts

588
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:21.980
u.

589
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.640
I put a key in the library just

590
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:24.740
in case.

591
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:25.500
Damn it!

592
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.600
The last one to laugh is...

593
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.280
There's no key.

594
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.760
That's strange.

595
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.240
That means the chief can't get in,

596
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.600
either.

597
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.980
All right!

598
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:38.920
Sorry.

599
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.620
You're both so slow.

600
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.020
He went outside.

601
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.140
Huh?

602
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.640
There's no key.

603
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.020
What's that sound?

604
00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.260
In here?

605
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.560
What's going on?

606
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.120
Damn it!

607
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.280
My library!

608
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.880
Chief, you're a little late.

609
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.920
I win.

610
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.680
You did a good job for your age.

611
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.240
Next year's New Year's Eve...

612
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.410
Next year's New Year's Eve...

613
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.920
I'm definitely going to call you!

614
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.040
So this is what happened this year, too.

615
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040
Oh...

616
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.900
Watch this year, too.

617
00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.640
I, Katsushika, appear in front

618
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.720
of the Kameyari Park.

619
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.260
My dad's sick?

620
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.360
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

621
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.680
It's not a big deal.

622
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:10.960
He'll get better in a few days.

623
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.080
Unfortunately, I can't wait for my family

624
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.420
's funeral.

625
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.440
Next time, on Japan's Most Irrespons

626
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.400
ible Parent and Child...

627
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.880
I'm counting on you!

628
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.810
It's going to be a sunny day

629
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.530
tomorrow Bye-bye Let's wave our

630
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:15.410
hands Goodbye to all the bad things Oh

631
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.590
yeah Let's live the way we want

632
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:25.870
to Good things will happen Outside the door,

633
00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.910
the sun is calling
